Our partners deliver advertising onto your mobile device.

If requested by our customers, we may combine that information with information we obtain from our customers or from third parties on our customers\u2019 behalf.  In this light, we largely rely on our business partners and customers to comply with applicable data protection law.  We use that information to determine generic Geo-location segments to help make the digital ads more relevant, and for ad delivery, analytics, and reporting purpose.  We also use the information to enhance our advertising and analytics capabilities.\r\n \r\nIn addition, we may obtain information via our website, which is primarily designed to provide information to our clients that are typically businesses.

    "activities": "ISS 24/7 provides a web-based Incident Management and text messaging solution to communicate incidents occurring during events at sports and entertainment venues. The system allows patrons to report an issue to staff through text messaging, and for staff to engage patrons in a 2-way text conversation. ISS 24/7's clients utilize the Incident Management System to associated persons for incidents. The information collected by the client (not ISS 24/7 directly) may include names, addresses, phone numbers, photos, driver licenses, etc.  \r\n\r\nWe only obtain the minimum amount of information we need to perform our services. At no time, will we allow personal information to be used for the promotion of unrelated services.\r\n\r\nData obtained from patrons in connection with this SMS service may include a cell phone number, carrier's name, and the date, time and content of messages and other information that may be provided. We may use this information to contact patrons and to provide the services requested from us, and to otherwise operate, develop and improve the service.",

    "activities": "We have two different sets of personal information that we collect:\r\n\r\n1. Information from StatusPage customer users. We consider these users as 'Admin Team Members'. These users input their email addresses in order to signup for an account with StatusPage and in order to authenticate on a daily basis to use the product. The emails are also used to show an activity log of actions that users take in their StatusPage account. Finally, the emails are used to send email notifications such as password reset emails.\r\n\r\n2. Information collected from our customers' end users' including email addresses and phone numbers. One key feature of our product is the ability for our customers to let their own end users subscribe to immediate downtime notifications via email and SMS. Our customers can either let their users opt-into notifications or use our API to import their users' information. We then send timely notifications to these email addresses and phone numbers when a given customer of ours creates an 'incident'.",

    "activities": "Kollective's Delivery Management System platform (\u201cDMS\u201d) enables enterprises to publish, distribute and manage digital materials easily and efficiently.  The DMS is intended for use internally within the enterprise regardless of network topography (i.e., across LANs but within the enterprise\u2019s WAN).  The DMS is \u201ccontent-agnostic\u201d; it can deliver any form of digital  material, but most often it is used for bandwidth intensive materials like video.  A typical use would be a CEO company-wide address or a company-wide meeting.  The content published and distributed via the DMS is solely under the control of the enterprise.  Kollective does not select, review or monitor content distributed.  The choice to distribute any personal information via the DMS is therefore that of Kollective\u2019s enterprise customer, and the use of such information internal to the enterprise is a matter of that enterprise\u2019s policies.  Kollective contractually requires its customers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the use of the DMS, including without limitation, any privacy or other rules pertaining to personal information.  Kollective also uses state-of-the-art security and encryption to protect against security breaches of the enterprise\u2019s content.",

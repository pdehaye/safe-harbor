All requests or complaints may be submitted via email to legal@exterro.com.  Once any request or complaint affecting these Principles has been submitted to Exterro the Safe Harbor team will promptly notify the data subject that the request or complaint has been received and is being investigated.  The Team will notify each data subject regarding the resolution of their request or complaint.  If a dispute remains after this self-assessment, Exterro will refer the dispute to the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (JAMS), an independent dispute resolution mechanism.  Exterro commits to cooperating fully with EU Data Protection Authorities and the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commission.",

In order to facilitate this, QFS Software will compute a one way hash (a garbled set of characters generated from your hardware and software information that is typically not possible to reverse engineer or decrypt) and store it in QFS servers. When you access QFS software, the hash value is computed on your computer/device and the garbled characters sent to QFS for comparison with the hash value (garbled characters) stored in QFS servers to authenticate the device. QFS does not know any information about your device \u2013 it only stores garbled characters. It is called a one way hash because the hash value cannot be (typically) reverse engineered or decrypted to arrive at the device information.\r\n\r\n\u2022\tTo administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature",

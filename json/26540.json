Schulman Inc. is seeking Safe Harbor Certification in order to be able to receive personal data from and regarding former, current and future employees (i.e. applicants / candidates) of the companies under common control of A.

Schulman adopted a \u2018Policy on Data Protection and Privacy of Personal Data\u2019 that creates a common core of values, policies and procedures intended to achieve nearly universal compliance.  This global policy, which is publicly available on our company website, will be supplemented with alternative or additional policies or implementation procedures applicable in those jurisdictions with unique requirements.\r\n\r\nIn line with the abovementioned policy, which incorporates amongst others the principles of EU Directive 95/46/EC regarding protection of personal data, A. Schulman Inc. insures that with regards to the employee data which it will receive:\r\n\u2022\tthe processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law; and,\r\n\u2022\tthat it will have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place aimed at protecting personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access and against all other unlawful forms of processing.  \r\n\r\nA. Schulman provides notification of its \u2018Policy on Data Protection and Privacy of Personal Data\u2019 to all employees through electronic and in-person means in different languages.  The policy includes contact information for employees to raise concerns (anonymously should they so desire).  Our company\u2019s employees with responsibility in the area of human resources are provided training on appropriate handling of personal information, and the company\u2019s internal audit department has responsibility for auditing compliance to the privacy policy as well as with safe harbor principles.",

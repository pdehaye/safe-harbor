If a complaint cannot be addressed by an employee's HR Manager, s/he will inform the employee and take the matter to the VP of HR.  Based on this discussion, the local HR Manager may then take further steps to resolve the problem, including discussing the matter with the Data Protection Compliance Office of their jurisdiction.  The organization further agrees, should a complaint be unsatisfactorily resolved via internal process, it will cooperate with the EU DPAs (Data Protection Authorities) to address unresolved complaints involving 'organization human resources data'.",

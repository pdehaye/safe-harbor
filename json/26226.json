    "activities": "Continuity Logic (CL) is a business-to-business (B2B) enterprise software company that offers governance management (business continuity, disaster recovery, risk and compliance management) software services to organizations largely domiciled in the United States, but also include the European Union.  When US multi-national corporations or EU organizations implement our software in order to manage their continuity of operations (business and IT), in the face of threats or incidents, they incorporate employee and vendor information into our people and vendor modules.  This information is limited to names as well as home and business addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses.  CL acts as the \u201cProcessor On Behalf\u201d to our clients (which are B2B only), assisting them in loading such information from an existing repository or system (such as SAP or PeopleSoft) into the CL database.  CL does NOT use the data at anytime, in anyway, for any purpose other than in service of the needs of the \u201cData Controller\u201d that is our client.  Such data is most frequently used by our clients for the purpose of notifying and mobilizing their appropriate employees and vendors, in order to engage in mitigation or recovery strategies, in the event of business interruptions or disasters.  CL does not have any contact with the customers of our client companies.",

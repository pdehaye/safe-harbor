As used herein, \u201cUsers\u201d refers to individuals who are authorized to use the Site either directly or as an authorized user of a Customer or Reseller of Skillsoft.\r\n\r\nThe privacy policy that pertains to the Site, a link to which is provided below, (the \u201cPrivacy Policy\u201d) applies only to the collection, storage and use of Users\u2019 information by Skillsoft pursuant to a written agreement either directly between Skillsoft and the individual User or through an agreement between Skillsoft and Customer or Skillsoft and Reseller, where the Customer or Reseller in turn makes the Site and Services available to individual Users authorized by Customer or Reseller (the \u201cAgreement\u201d). The Privacy Policy does not apply to any collection or use of any User information by a Customer or Reseller and does not apply to www.Skillsoft.com or to top-level domains for www.Skillport.com or www.books24x7.com, which are public, informational splash screens designed to provide additional information about the Services. The Skillsoft Learning App (the \u201cApp\u201d) provides Users with mobile access to the Site and Services.  The App is subject to the terms of the Skillsoft Learning App Privacy Policy, a link to which is provided on the App and through the Privacy Policy below. \r\n\r\nExcept as set forth in the Privacy Policy or the Agreement, Skillsoft will only receive User personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) upon a Customer or Reseller\u2019s direction or when necessary to provide, maintain or improve the Services. The Customer or Reseller generally determines the nature and scope of the Services, what information is to be provided to the Site by Users (including whether PII should be provided), how Users\u2019 information is used, with whom the information may be shared, what choices are available to Users regarding collection, use and distribution of the information, and the kinds of security procedures required of the Site to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that is under Skillsoft's sole control.\r\n\r\nIf a Customer or Reseller chooses to collect PII from Users or if a User chooses to provide PII to Skillsoft, such as in connection with sign-on credentials or User-generated content or communications, or for any other purpose, Skillsoft will only use that information to provide, maintain or improve the specific Services or as otherwise permitted in the Privacy Policy or the Agreement. Skillsoft may also use PII to contact Customers, Resellers and Users, for example, to send them marketing materials or other information about Skillsoft and its services.",

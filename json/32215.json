    "activities": "Collection of Information\r\nWe collect PII, like names, postal addresses, email addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our visitors. The information you provide is used to fulfill your specific request. This information is only used to fulfill your specific request, unless you give Us permission to use it in another manner, for example to add you to one of Our mailing lists. We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Policy (see the section entitled \u201cService Provider\u201d below).\r\nTracking Technology\r\nTechnologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts are used by Suddath and Our marketing partners, affiliates, and customer support providers. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the Site, tracking users\u2019 movements around the Site, and to gather demographic information about Our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as an aggregated basis.\r\nWe use cookies to remember users\u2019 settings (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use Our Site, but your ability to use some features or areas of Our Site may be limited.\r\nLog files\r\nAs is true of most web sites, We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information We collect about you. We do this to improve services We offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or Site functionality.\r\nService Providers\r\nWe use other third parties to facilitate and provide international transportation services, such as crating/assembly, customs clearance, trucking, air or ocean freight services, packing, and unpacking. Information you provide to Suddath through the Site may be used when, pursuant to the requirements of your relocation, you are in need of any of the services listed above. Suddath will share only the PII that is relevant to the specific relocation services being provided by the third party. We do not sell your PII to third parties and these third parties are prohibited from using your PII for any other purpose. These companies are authorized to use your personally identifiable information only as necessary to provide these services to Us.\r\nDistribution of Information\r\nWe reserve the right to disclose your PII (i) to governmental agencies or other companies assisting Us in fraud prevention or investigation; (ii) as required by law; and (iii) when We believe that disclosure is necessary to protect Our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Our web site. We will only disclose PII to governmental agencies or other companies when trying to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud or unauthorized transactions or investigating fraud that has already taken place. PII is never provided to these governmental agencies or companies for marketing purposes.\r\nIf Suddath is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on Our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your PII, as well as any choices you may have regarding your PII.\r\nThird Party Websites\r\nSuddath may also permit you to access third party sites directly from Our Site to provide you with value-added information, functionality, or services. If you provide PII through these sites, your information may be shared with these third-party entities and so your information is governed by their privacy policies. Please note that the third party's privacy policy and its terms and conditions will apply to you. We encourage you to learn about each third party's privacy policy before sharing PII with them.",

    "activities": "Opera Mediaworks does not collect personal information directly from individuals but rather receives information via partners\u2019 mobile messages, mobile web sites and mobile applications as well as from third party service providers (e.g., mobile carrier operators). In this light, Mediaworks relies on our customer partners and these third party service providers to inform their users about the purposes for which it collects and uses their personal information.  To the best of our ability we inform our partners the need to offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-out) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. Consistent with the U.S. Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) without requiring parental consent. When Mediaworks receives personal information from the entities described above (in the EU, Switzerland or elsewhere), we will use such information only in accordance with the principles set forth here, the notices such entities provided and the choices made by the individuals to whom such personal information relates. \r\n\r\nWhen our customer partner\u2019s end users connect to the technical service on their mobile device, Mediaworks may automatically receive from their mobile phone service provider or our customer partner information identifying the user\u2019s unique mobile device, their phone number and/or other unique identifiers for their device (\u201cMobile Device Information\u201d). For the avoidance of doubt, end users are not \u201cUsers\u201d covered by this Privacy Policy, and any private information that we collect from the end users is governed by the customer partner or mobile phone service provider privacy policies, if any, and not this Privacy Policy.  \r\n\r\nMediaworks does use a \u201cpixel tags\" and/or similar technologies, in our communications to enable us to evaluate when and if advertisements are viewable on the mobile device.  A pixel tag is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), included in the advertising creative, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message.",

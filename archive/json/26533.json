    "activities": "Eckoh-owned IVR units accept calls from subscribing customers who report power outages.  The customer enters an identifier (CLI) which is used to find their account details which include personally identifiable information in a shadow database received from the utility and mounted on Eckoh-owned systems. A restoration table managed by software on the Eckoh-owned server is consulted to provide the caller with an estimated time of restoration and other outage details. A call detail record (CDR) is created and is transmitted to Eckoh-owned servers residing in facilities leased from British Telecom and IX Europe. The outage management system (OMS), which is owned and operated by the utility, provides a periodic transfer of outage status records to TFCC.  The CDR is re-formatted by TFCC and is transmitted to the client OMS. These data transmissions traverse a wide-area network (WAN) which is operated by British Telecom.  The data transmissions pass through Eckoh-owned equipment on the utility premise.  The data traverses the utility firewall and internal networks.  CDRs provide input to the OMS prediction logic to enhance restoration efforts.  The CDR serves as a customer contact record and may be ingested by the customer information system (CIS).  The CIS generates a new shadow database file which is transmitted to Eckoh which replaces the previous copy of the database already in production.  WNI employees in the U.S. may have access to customer data.\r\n\r\nThe following is a listing of servers in the UK which process customer data:\r\n\r\n10.189.110.10   oddjob1sa.sta.tfcci.local*\r\n10.189.111.32   web3hvca.sta.tfcci.*\r\n10.189.111.24   web2hvca.sta.tfcci.local*\r\n10.189.111.23   web1hvca.sta.tfcci.local*\r\n10.189.110.45   sas1.sta.tfcci.local\r\n10.189.132.24   real1.sta.tfcci.local\r\n10.189.132.22   prod3.sta.tfcci.local\r\n10.189.111.21   prod2.sta.tfcci.local*\r\n10.189.132.20   prod1.sta.tfcci.local\r\n10.189.132.23   db1psta.sta.tfcci.local*\r\n10.189.132.29   app1hvca.sta.tfcci.local\r\n10.190.111.32   web3hvca.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.111.23   web2hvca.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.111.22   web1hvca.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.110.38   test1hh.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.110.37   sas1.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.132.23   real1.htr.tfcci.local\r\n10.190.111.21   prod2.htr.tfcci.local*\r\n10.190.132.20   prod1.htr.tfcci.local\r\n10.190.110.22   db1phtr.htr.tfcci.local\r\n10.190.132.28   app1hvca.htr.tfcci.local",

    "activities": "Mather Economics\u2019 operations are based on weekly processing of client data through pre-built and custom Extract Transform Load (ETL) processes, econometric models, and structured output. Every week, clients transfer their customer information in flat files to Mather Economics\u2019 secure file transfer protocol (SFTP) site with key information for processing and evaluation of customer metrics. Mather Economics captures data and applies custom scripts to clean data, prepares data for analysis by adding custom fields and proprietary variables, appends demographics and other metadata, runs proprietary econometric models to propose an optimal solution for each client customer, formats data to enable processing by client, and exports data for client processing via SFTP.  Specific engagement terms, deliverables, and customer and Company responsibilities, including those related to security and confidentiality considerations, are outlined in engagement letters that define service commitments and requirements.",

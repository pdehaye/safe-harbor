    "activities": "We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.\r\nWe use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.\r\nWe use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We will occasionally send our customers emails regarding new features and upgrades to our services that will benefit them, and that is the extent of the \"marketing\" that is done to customers. We DO NOT send email to non-customers, except in cases where those email addresses are used as points-of-contact when a site is set up. We do not harvest emails nor do we do any data mining on the information we collect.\r\nWe use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. With respect to cookies, we use cookies to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart. With respect to ad servers, we do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.\r\nFinally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. In certain instances (e.g. domain name registrations), you are asked to submit your information yourself for the purposes of receiving information or for purchasing additional products or services that complement the services you order from CrystalTech. In those instances, you will be advised that you are submitting your information to a third party, and you will be given the opportunity to opt-out of providing that information (and therefore, of purchasing the product or services).\r\nWe use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.",

    "activities": "Different NQ Mobile products collect different types of personal information.  NQ Mobile US may collect personal information and device information from a user, or in the case of our NQ Family Guardian mobile application (\u201cNQ FG\u201d), a user\u2019s child, including, but not limited to: name, address, telephone number, mobile device brand name, model and IMEI or other unique device identifiers, location information, software installed and applications running in the phone, your email username and password (if importing contacts), a user\u2019s network connection, favorites, downloading activity and other activity, and information about the user\u2019s use of our web sites, including language and content preferences. For our mobile security products, additional personal information is accessed so as to prevent eavesdropping and otherwise help keep contacts and communications private and backup content, including, but not limited to, user\u2019s call logs, contacts, photos and videos. NQ FG collects additional personal information from the user and user\u2019s child in order to provide comprehensive security services to monitor and protect the user or user\u2019s child, including, but not limited to, information in email, contacts, call log, parent\u2019s email address, password and a child\u2019s name or display name as well as their age range and a parent\u2019s mobile number. We partner and may partner in the future with third parties to display or manage services provided to you, and those partners may collect information about your activities on our sites and products.  For the personal information we may collect from the user or, in the case of NQ FG, the user\u2019s child, while using our products or services, personal information will be kept confidential. We expect to use user\u2019s personal information for the following purposes: to (i) provide the user with information related to virus warnings, product upgrades, customer service, newsletters, email updates, and to further increase our customer feedback for our future products and to better receive user\u2019s suggestions for the improvement of our products and services; (ii) help us create content, products and services relevant and useful to users; (iii) provide the user with additional information that is tailored to the user\u2019s specific needs or interests; (iv) enable the user to purchase and download our products, access our services or participate in the activities the user selects; (v) help the user to quickly find the appropriate software, service or product information; (vi)  provide updated, comprehensive security services for the user; (vii) allow copartners whom have agreed to keep the information confidential to perform work on our behalf; and (vii) allow us to help keep contacts and communications private, view the user\u2019s account through the user\u2019s online account, block numbers from calling the user or texting the user, and back up the user\u2019s contacts, as the user may request.   Additionally, for NQ FG, we expect to use the user\u2019s, and the user\u2019s child\u2019s, personal information for the following purposes: to help parents to keep track of their child\u2019s location, messages, call history, applications and photos; to limit when the user\u2019s child can unlock their phone, make phone calls, use the web and text; to protect the user\u2019s child against bad influences by blocking calls, and messages to and from contacts that the user adds to the block list; and to allow the user to have the user\u2019s child check in.  \r\n\r\nWe do not sell or otherwise share the user\u2019s personal information, other than the necessary service providers, except (i) with customers\u2019 written consent; (ii) when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect user\u2019s safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; (iii) to prevent the rights and interests of others from material detriments; (iv) to promote public interests without damaging user\u2019s vital interests; (v) to comply with laws or regulations, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; and (vi) to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as processing payments, providing mapping services or offering customer service.  If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, users will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of user\u2019s personal information, as well as any choices user may have regarding user\u2019s personal information. We will retain user\u2019s or user\u2019s child\u2019s information (including geo-location data) for as long as user\u2019s NQ account is active or as needed to provide services. If user wishes to cancel user account or request that we no longer use user\u2019s information to provide services, user may contact us at privacy@nq.com. We will retain and use information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and, when in an aggregate and anonymized form, for any legitimate business purpose.

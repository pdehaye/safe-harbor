    "activities": "Decision Analyst, Inc. operates the following online survey access panels and websites: American Consumer Opinion; The Technology Advisory Board; The Physicians Advisory Council; The Medical Advisory Board; The Contractor Advisory Board; The Executive Advisory Board; and Imaginators. The purpose of these online access panels is the conduct of projects to help European companies, and companies operating in Europe, make better marketing and business decisions. Any personal information given to us during the registration process (when individuals join our access panels) is used to qualify members for future surveys or projects. The information given to us by participants during research projects is typically compiled into statistical summaries for reporting purposes. Individual-level data or answers are sometimes shared with the relevant client, but the personal identity of individual respondents is not revealed--without respondents' explicit permission. For focus groups, depth interviews, ideation projects, online communities, online message boards and similar qualitative projects individual-level data and respondent identity can only be released to the client with the respondent's permission.  The individual-level data of each person is secure and private, and is never given or sold to third parties. Decision Analyst also operates an online affiliate program, the sole purpose of which is to recruit members to the above online access panels. Any personal information provided during registration is used to qualify participants as affiliates and to communicate with them. This information is always secure and private, and is never given or sold to third parties. No other personal data is collected outside the registration form for affiliates. We are a member of the Better Business Bureau, CASRO, and ESOMAR and reaffirm those memberships each year.",

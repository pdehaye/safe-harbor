    "activities": "Notice and Choice\r\nTo the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement, we reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved.  Where we collect personal information directly from individuals in the E.U., we inform them about the types of personal information we collect from them, if any, the purposes for which we collect and use it, and the types of non-agent third parties to which we disclose that information, if any.  We also inform those individuals about the choices and means, if any, we offer individuals for limiting the use or disclosure of their information. \r\nDisclosures\r\nMerlin will not disclose an individual's personal information to third parties, except when one or more of the following conditions is true: \r\n?\tWe have the individual's permission to make the disclosure; \r\n?\tThe disclosure is required by law or professional standards; \r\n?\tThe personal information in question is publicly available; \r\n?\tThe disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims.\r\nData Security\r\nMerlin will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information.  To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use and confidentiality of personal information, either for its own purposes or on behalf of our clients, Merlin has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the personal information we process.  However, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to Merlin via the Internet. \r\nData Integrity\r\nMerlin will process personal information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual.  To the extent necessary for such purposes, Merlin will take reasonable steps to make sure that personal information is accurate, complete, current, and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use.\r\nAccess and Correction\r\nIf an individual becomes aware that personal information we maintain about that individual is inaccurate, or if an individual would like to update or review his or her personal information, the individual may contact us using the contact information below.  We will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete personal information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate.  The individual will need to provide sufficient identifying personal information, such as full name, address, birth date, and driver license number or government-issued identification card number.  We may request additional identifying personal information as a security precaution.  In addition, we may limit or deny access to personal information where providing such access would be unreasonably burdensome or expensive in the circumstances, or as otherwise permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement.  \r\nEnforcement and Dispute Resolution\r\nMerlin utilizes the self-assessment approach to assure its compliance with our privacy statement. Merlin periodically verifies that the policy is accurate, comprehensive for the information intended to be covered, prominently displayed, completely implemented, and in conformity with the Principles.  We encourage interested persons to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below.  We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of personal information in accordance with the principles contained in this Policy. \r\nWith respect to any complaints relating to this Policy that cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the EU data protection authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles.  If we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with this Policy, we will take appropriate st",

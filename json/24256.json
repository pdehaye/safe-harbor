    "activities": "LDM GLOBAL LDM is a premier information management and litigation support solutions provider - specialising in data recovery, computer forensics, large scale electronic and paper based disclosure services and international projects.  Protecting the privacy of our clients is of paramount importance to LDM GLOBAL.  LDM GLOBAL adheres to the Safe Harbor Agreement concerning the transfer of personal data from the European Union (\"EU\") to the United States of America.  Accordingly, LDM GLOBAL follows the Safe Harbor Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce (\"Principles\") with respect to all such data. If there is any conflict between the policies in this statement and the Principles, the Principles will govern.  This statement outlines LDM GLOBAL\u2019s general policy and practices for implementing the Principles, including the types of information we gather, how we use it, and the choices affected individuals have regarding our use of, and their ability to correct, that information. \r\nThis statement applies to all personal information we handle (except as noted below), including on-line, off-line, and manually processed data.  For purposes of this statement, \"personal information\" means information that: \r\n\u2022\tIs transferred from the EU to the United States; \r\n\u2022\tIs recorded in any form; \r\n\u2022\tIs about, or pertains to, a specific individual; and \r\n\u2022\tCan be linked to that individual. \r\nIt does not include information that pertains to a specific individual, but from which that individual could not reasonably be identified. \r\nPrinciples Protecting Individuals' Privacy\r\nNotice and Choice\r\nTo the extent permitted by the Safe Harbor Agreement, we reserve the right to process personal information in the course of providing professional services to our clients without the knowledge of individuals involved.  Where we collect, at the direction of our clients, personal information directly from individuals in the E.U. it remains the responsibility of our client to inform the individual of the purposes for which we collect and use it and the types of non-agent third parties to which the information is disclosed.  It remains the responsibility of our client to inform those individuals about the choices and means, if any, offered the individuals for limiting the use or disclosure of their information. \r\nDisclosures and Transfers\r\nLDM GLOBAL will not disclose an individual's personal information to third parties unless directed by our client or when one or more of the following conditions is true: \r\n\u2022\tWe have the individual's permission to make the disclosure; \r\n\u2022\tThe disclosure is required by law or professional standards; \r\n\u2022\tThe disclosure is reasonably related to the sale or disposition of all or part of our business; \r\n\u2022\tThe information in question is publicly available; \r\n\u2022\tThe disclosure is reasonably necessary for the establishment or defense of legal claims; or \r\n\u2022\tThe disclosure is to another LDM GLOBAL entity or to persons or entities providing services on our, or our client\u2019s behalf (each a \"transferee\"), consistent with the purpose for which the information was obtained, if the transferee, with respect to the information in question: \r\no\tIs subject to law providing an adequate level of privacy protection; \r\no\tHas agreed in writing to provide an adequate level of privacy protection; or \r\no\tSubscribes to the Principles. \r\nPermitted transfers of information, either to third parties or within LDM GLOBAL, include the transfer of data from one jurisdiction to another, including transfers to and from the United States of America. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, personal information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the information originated. \r\nData Security\r\nLDM GLOBAL takes our clients security seriously and undertakes every reasonable step to protect their information.

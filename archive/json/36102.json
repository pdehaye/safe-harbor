Activities vary according to the particular engagement with a specific customer, but the vast majority of information to which we have access is business contact information, sales related information, or other information collected in connection with our customers programs. Information may be used for a variety of purposes, most particularly customer service on our customers' behalf, marketing and training. As part of our consulting services, some customers may allow us to maintain or provide us with access to data. In connection with those services, Acumen Solutions typically does not control the data and any access to or use of such data is incidental to completing its contractual requirements for such customer.",

Using these Kiosks, end users of Operator's Kiosks can purchase or sell their virtual currency, such as bitcoins. Operators appoint Robocoin to collect and store their end user information on their behalf for purposes of fulfilling the Operator\u2019s interests and obligations in verifying the end users\u2019 identities, preventing fraud, and preventing unlawful and abusive activity. When Operators choose to use Robocoin\u2019s identity verification service, the Robocoin Platform collects a range of Personally-Identifying Information from and about its account holders and end users. Much of this information is provided by users themselves when they enroll with the Kiosk, create an account and use the services on the Kiosk and Site.",

    "activities": "Xendo is a business productivity tool that provides unified search across a user's online business accounts.  The user themselves (or a company administrator) connects the online services to Xendo's search engine through a 'handshake' mechanism (OAuth) that means Xendo does not know or store users, usernames or passwords.  Xendo builds a unified, searchable index based on the content that resides in the user-connected services, for example; documents, emails, messages, contacts, tasks, events.  Search results may show snippets of content from these online sources including a link to the system where the content resides, so the user may easily navigate to the original source of the content.",

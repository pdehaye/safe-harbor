    "activities": "The business of Loqate is address verification. We provide companies the ability to capture, clean, verify, and format building and street addresses in any country in the world. We only deal in physical addresses, not email addresses. Part of our work is to collect reference addresses from companies that do business in those countries. Such sources could include postal services, telephone companies, shipping companies, and other organizations that deal with physical addresses. The data that is transferred to Loqate from those sources is in the vast majority of cases only the address - building number, suite number, street name, city, and so on. The address alone is not enough to identify an individual so for that data privacy concerns do not apply.\r\n\r\nLoqate does not use the information about the person or the address for any other purpose other than to identify that the address actually exists. In the case that data that could uniquely identify a person is accessed, that data is only used to match the input sent to Loqate software by a user or another software application. Based on our software algorithms, a match is made between the input data and the reference data and a score is assigned to the quality of the match. The data from data providers is used as one of the factors to create that score. \r\n\r\nLoqate will process the reference data received from data providers into a proprietary format and then encrypt the data to prevent access without the Loqate software. The reference data can then be safely installed in a customer's data center or organization. Alternatively, the software and underlying reference data can be accessed by applications in the cloud or over the Internet. In either manner, no user has direct access to the raw data from data providers or any other source within the EU or anywhere in the world. \r\n\r\nData providers are the data controller in this case. Loqate does have the ability to remove and will remove an address from the reference data should a person request that removal. \r\n\r\nBecoming a party to Safe Harbor is important in that it will reduce the amount of paperwork and time necessary to complete sales with our customers. Without Safe Harbor, each one of our customers and their potential customer would need to agree to the data protection agreements. This is impractical, if not impossible.",

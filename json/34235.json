    "activities": "NeuroCog Trials [also referred to as \u2018NCT Holdings, Inc.\u2019 that includes NeuroCog Trials (NCT) and NCT Linguistics (NCTL)] is a clinical and cognition assessment services company that offers consulting, site screening, translation, rater training and certification, data review, and statistical analysis services to companies for clinical trial data that is collected from global sites.     \r\n\r\nNCT collects, processes, translates, analyzes and stores cognitive and clinical test data from clinical trials for their Study Sponsors.  This test data may be captured on paper or electronically and it may include personal information from the subject or site raters.  NCT works with the Study Sponsor to ensure that the subjects and site raters understand what type of data is being collected and to clarify the purpose for collecting the data.  NCT works with the Study Sponsor and site rater(s) to limit the collection of any personal data that is not relevant to the study.  In these types of studies, only the Study Sponsor will have the ability to contact an individual directly in order to allow them to opt out of any disclosures of personal data that are not previously authorized.\r\nIn some cases NCT may collect the data for a research study on their own (e.g. under a research grant).   In these cases NCT will work with an Investigational Review Board (IRB) or Ethics Committee (EC) to ensure that subjects and raters understand what type of data is collected and to clarify the purpose for collecting the data.  In these types of studies, NCT will limit the collection of any personal data for individuals participating in the study that is not relevant to the study.  \r\nThe electronic data captured for studies may include audio or video recordings of the cognitive test assessments.  These recordings are used to provide feedback to the site rater on their performance of testing and to correct errors in the data that is collected.  NCT ensures that the site staff are trained to take all measures possible to conceal the identity of the subject during these recordings.",

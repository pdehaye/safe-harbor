Thus, for each Organization, the Administrator decides which information is available for access or review by entrepreneurs and/or other Organizations, and which information is not to be disclosed, or is disclosed to selected entrepreneurs and/or other Organizations, according to the policies of the Organization. Please note that (1) the default settings that are set by an Organization Administrator may change from time to time; (2) each Organization may opt for different default settings.

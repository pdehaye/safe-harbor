It seems that any time this would be required, BRG would be exempt from any Safe Harbor \u201cchoice\u201d requirement or be required to provide the individual \u201caccess\u201d to delete or correct any of the information.\r\n\u2022\tBRG receives personal information in data provided by another party such as data collected from a company or in data produced from another party or entity.\r\nSince any personal information, whether obtained from a person\u2019s personal device or data obtained from their employer or any other party would be BRG work product, it would be kept confidential under BRG\u2019s Data Security Policies and Procedures and there would be no use of the personal data that would require notice to the individual.",

In order to create a social network on the Ning platform, an individual (the \"Network Creator\") must register for account credentials. When registering for account credentials, Ning collects certain personal information from the Network Creator, including a name, email address, and a password. In addition, Network Creators must provide their credit card or other payment instrument information and telephone number (for customer support purposes).\r\n \r\nThose who sign up to become a member of a social network created on the Ning platform (\"members\") provide certain personal information to that social network's Network Creator.

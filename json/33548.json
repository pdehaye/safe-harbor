    "activities": "Website Visitors\r\n\r\nCedexis collects non-personally-identifying information about visits to the Website, such as the browser used, referring site, and the time and date of each web request. We collect this information to understand how visitors use the Website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, such as by publishing reports on usage trends. We also collect traffic data, like IP addresses. Cedexis does not use such information to identify its visitors and does not disclose such information other than under the circumstances described below.\r\nPortal Visitors\r\n\r\nAdditional information, including an e-mail address, is collected from Portal users. We collect only such information as is needed to identify a Portal user and verify their authorization for the Portal, except as described below in Financial Information in the case of making payments through the Portal. Portal users in the same customer account have access to each other\u2019s email addresses. Personally identifying information cannot be viewed or updated for users in other customer accounts. The Portal distributes a Portal user\u2019s username and password via email upon account sign-up and if specifically requested by the user.\r\nCookies\r\n\r\nA \u201ccookie\u201d is an alphanumeric identifier that is unique to your browser. The cookie will identify your browser to us when you visit our Website and Portal. Cedexis visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our services, with the drawback that certain features of Cedexis services might not function properly without the aid of cookies.\r\nCedexis Radar and Cedexis Openmix\r\n\r\nCedexis Radar and Cedexis Openmix are services provided by Cedexis to our customers and partners in order to measure and improve Internet user experience. As part of operation, these services collect information, such as the user\u2019s IP address, time of visit, and the browser\u2019s User-Agent, to inform network routing choices and other service decisions. This data is not correlated to additional personally identifiable information. IP address information that is made available to our customers and partners as part of reporting is anonymized. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, such as by publishing reports on trends.\r\nProtection of Personally Identifying Information\r\n\r\nCedexis undertakes industry standard security measures to protect data, such as encryption (e.g. SSL) and physical security, to guard against unauthorized access to data and systems where data is stored. These measures include automated systems as well as a security awareness guide for Cedexis personnel.\r\n\r\nCedexis shares potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only with our contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that information to support Cedexis services. Any such contractor or affiliated organization has agreed not to disclose it to others. The contractors or affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country - by using Cedexis services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We do not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone, and we take all reasonable measures to protect it. If Cedexis becomes involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will ensure the confidentiality of any personal information involved in such transactions. Personal information may be disclosed to judicial or other government agencies subject to warrants, subpoenas, or other governmental orders.\r\n\r\nAccess to personally identifying information by Cedexis personnel is limited by industry standard encryption and authentication mechanisms such as SSL and strong passwords. In the event Cedexis personnel leave the company or should no longer have access to personally identifying information, their access to personally identifying information is revoked immediately.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a security breech which compromises personally identifying information we will notify affected users within 30 days of detection and explain the nature of the breech, when the breech occurred, information about the data compromised, and any steps the user should take.\r\nData Retention and Disaster Recovery\r\n\r\nData is backed up and distributed among our geographically dispersed data centers in case of catastrophic failure. Integrity of these backups and the procedures for recovering from catastrophic failure are verified on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nCedexis Openmix and Cedexis Radar logs are kept for at least 13 months after use of the service. Upon Portal account termination, information is retained for at least one year from the time of termination. If you would like this Portal account-related information expunged more quickly, please send us a request specifying your preference.\r\nFinancial Information\r\n\r\nSome Cedexis services require payment that may be taken through the Portal using credit card information. Cedexis does not store this personal financial information in its systems and relies on the services of Zuora for customer financial information storage (if any). Zuora\u2019s security policy is available at http://zuora.com/privacy.html.\r\nChildren\u2019s Privacy\r\n\r\nCedexis functionality and content are directed toward and designed for use by persons aged 13 or older. We do not solicit or knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that we have received personally identifiable information from an individual who indicates that he or she is, or whom we otherwise have reason to believe is, under the age of 13, we will delete such information from our systems.\r\nSafe Harbor\r\n\r\nIn accordance with our commitment to protect personal privacy, Cedexis complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Cedexis has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. These principles and FAQs may be found at: http://www.export.gov/safeharbor\r\nOpt-Out Policy\r\n\r\nYou can use the Cedexis Portal to review and change the personally identifying information stored by Cedexis. If you change your mind about the use of information volunteered by you, please send us a request specifying your new choice.",

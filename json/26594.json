As a Data Processor, MSC prepares the data for marketing campaigns according to specific instructions given by DCs.

At 90-days, MSC will erase DC files and back-up files unless the DC instructs MSC otherwise.  MSC does not convert, process or forward data without DC instruction.  MSC does not derive ownership, or ownership responsibilities, in the course or manipulating DC data. \r\n(Data Comptrollers are individuals or companies that compile, maintain and manage personal data.)",

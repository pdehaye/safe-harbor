    "activities": "To obtain an account to use the Reput app, a user provides his or her basic contact information, such as name, nickname, email address and/or telephone number.  The app\u2019s main feature is that it allows users to communicate with other users who we believe share one or more of the same contacts in their address books.  (For example, if 150 users have johnsmith@example.com in their address book, the app will allow them to communicate with each other through the app.)  To coordinate this exchange of communications on our systems while reducing the amount of data we collect from users, the app presently utilizes a \u201chashing\u201d function.  When a user first logs in to the app (and again later, after clicking the \u201cSync Contacts\u201d button), the app sends to Reput a one-way hash of each email address and certain other contact details of each of the people in the user\u2019s address book.  The Reput Privacy Notice referenced in this certification provides more extensive details regarding our data collection practices.",

    "activities": "We analyze documents for corporations that are involved in law suits or contract disputes to see if they are relevant to the case or contract. Generally per order of a judge we receive emails, word docs, excel spreadsheets etc from the custodians that work for the opposing party to the one we are working for. Then using computers that are running AI applications we determine which documents are relevant to the case. Generally our software discards 90% of the documents and they are not read by a human. Some of the remaining 10% of the documents e.g. email may contain personal information. So it is possible that some personal information is received in the legal documents that we are reviewing.",

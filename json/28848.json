    "activities": "ZKTeco provides a time and attendance solution (ZK-DCS) that interfaces to a product offered by a partner company, Workday. The ZK-DCS allows punches from time clocks to be processed through to the Workday application, while also allowing employee data previously entered into the Workday time tracking module to be shown for informational purposes.  ZKTeco's application does not allow entry or modification of data received for presentation from the Workday time tracking module.  The ZK-DCS has no means to store long term data as the functionality is simply to push data through into the time tracking module as soon as possible, and to show data already entered for convenience.",

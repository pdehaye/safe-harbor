(\"ACI\") does not sell products or services directly to individual consumers, but instead is a technology services provider (TSP or third party provider) to various institutional clients.  As a normal part of these services, it is necessary for ACI to record, store, process, transmit, and otherwise handle personally identifiable information (hereafter referred to as \"personal information\") about individual consumers.  In the course of its business, ACI has established appropriate controls to ensure that \"personal information\" is disclosed only to those who have a legitimate business need for such access.  ACI records, stores, processes, transmits and otherwise handles \"personal information\" as contractually directed by its institutional clients.  ACI exclusively provides such \"personal information\" to the institutional client that owns the information, the institutional clients' users or an ACI affiliated third party (except as otherwise required by federal, state, or local agencies).",

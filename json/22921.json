    "activities": "Trilegiant acts as a data controller and processor for our affiliates and supports their business offerings as a data controller and processor as defined in the Directive. In doing so, we act at the specific direction of the European affiliates and/or former European affiliates.  Written instructions are provided by such affiliates and/or former affiliates outlining the authority granted to Trilegiant as the data controller and processor. \r\n\r\nThe data transferred is on-line data, off-line data and manually processed data.  The data transferred to Trilegiant includes (i) customer data housed in the databases of the clients of its European affiliates and/or former European affiliates and (ii) data relating to the employees and/or former employees of its European affiliates and/or former European affiliates.  The data will also be processed by Trilegiant in the following way: managed hosting and off-line backups for recovery purposes which are stored on-site and archived off-site.  The manual processing is limited to use of the data in problem solving and movement of databases for normal operational upgrades, recoveries and other actions to assure integrity, security and operability of the servers as needed by its clients, affiliates, and/or former affiliates.  This is the necessary technical and database support required to assure continuous operation of the servers.  Manual handling is on a need-to-know basis by authorized operations staff, technical support persons, database administrators, network administrators, and security administrators and is only accessed for problem solving, backups and normal computer operations movement of data. Where we act as a data controller with respect to employee data, we may use the data for legitimate business purposes including but not limited to staff administration, maintaining relevant records for HR purposes and other personnel matters in relation to staff.",

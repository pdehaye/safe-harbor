Its privacy policy regarding personal information received from the EU conforms to the Safe Harbor Principles and individuals are informed of the mechanisms through which they may pursue complaints. \r\n\r\nData Quality is addressed for the organizations employee data and the customer\u2019s private or personal data. Employee\u2019s data is collected via our service of TriNet and stored electronically with that carrier.

These standards are attested to by a 3rd party at least once a year. 2014 Attestation was completed Q1 2014 and is available for review via Attestation Letter and Review Data. The specific areas addressed by ISO 27002 are the Human Resources Security, the Physical Security, the Access Management and the Incident Management categories.

Additionally, in 2014, Actiance is preparing for the SSAE16 SOC 2 Audit where three complementing categories are Integrity, Confidentiality and Privacy.\r\nData Controllers are addressed via Actiance\u2019s customer contracts.  The \"Data Controller\" is the responsible \u201cnotifier\u201d of the purpose of the processing; a description of the data subjects; the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data might be disclosed; proposed transfers to third countries.",

Borderfree will carefully process your personal information, with at least the same level of privacy protection set forth in the the U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and the U.S. - Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles and as established by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Borderfree also agrees not to sell, transfer, or otherwise use your information other than for processing international shipments.\r\n\r\nWhen you indicate you are shipping internationally, you will be redirected to a checkout page hosted by Borderfr. On the checkout page you will be required to submit personal information to Borderfree to complete your order. Once you place your order, you will be prompted to confirm whether you would like to receive future marketing communication from bloomingdales.com.\r\n\r\nBorderfree will notify bloomingdales.com of the approval of your order, and bloomingdales.com will then ship approved orders to Borderfree. Simultaneously, Borderfree will purchase the product from us, which allows them to take title to the product(s), bill your credit card, collect and remit any duties and taxes to the appropriate taxing authority and arrange for the product to be delivered to you. In this process, Borderfree makes the sale to you as the merchant of record. When ordering a product, you will be presented with Borderfree's terms and conditions. You must agree to them to receive the product(s) you ordered.\r\n\r\nOnce you have agreed that Borderfree may share your personal information with bloomingdales.com, that data is protected by this notice of privacy practices and you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on our servers located in the United States.\r\n\r\nWe adhere to both the EU and Swiss Safe Harbor Privacy Principles. We have certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Switzerland, and the European Union that our processing of personal data is in compliance with these principles and we perform periodic self-assessments to verify ongoing compliance.\r\n\r\nBloomingdales.com is committed to resolving any customer concerns regarding their privacy. If a customer feels that their privacy may have been violated, based on the Safe Harbor Principles, bloomingdales.com will attempt to directly resolve the complaint.

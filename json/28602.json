    "activities": "ThreatMetrix is a privately held technology company that assists organizations to prevent web fraud and enable e-commerce. ThreatMetrix\u2019s device fingerprinting solution (a.k.a. fraud network) helps online businesses verify new accounts, authorize payments and transactions, and authenticate user logins in real-time. While the solution does not require the collection and use of personally identifiable information (PII), ThreatMetrix customers may choose to provide such information to increase device identification effectiveness. ThreatMetrix provides salted hash controls that suppress sensitive data fields including name and address. It is important to note that ThreatMetrix is the processor and is never a controller of this data. ThreatMetrix profiles the device used in an online transaction so companies can determine whether the users are fraudsters or customers. ThreatMetrix device profiling goes beyond browser fingerprinting to identify the device, bypass proxies and detect the use of botnets.",

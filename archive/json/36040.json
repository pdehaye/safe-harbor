In addition, Aggregate Knowledge normalizes third-party market segmentation data, including demographic, behavioral, and contextual data, from trusted sources to improve the targeting accuracy and performance of its solution. To the extent AK customers in the EU and Switzerland use PII in connection with AK services (i.e., their own CRM data), AK processes that information as a processor only, and that data remains in the EU, subject to applicable law.  Advertisers and their agents use our services to measure campaign performance across all channels, including Facebook, and effectively allocate media dollars to increase reach and drive new sales.",

Our products and services assists the way organizers manage their activities and events by automating online registrations and streamlining other critical management functions, while also driving consumer participation to their events. ACTIVE\u2019s websites include online communities for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate. Using ACTIVE\u2019s services, users can learn about upcoming events, and, in some circumstances, to register for those events and tell friends about the events. ACTIVE\u2019s services may also be used by organizations to provide users the ability to take certain actions. For example, ACTIVE may create or host websites and mobile applications on the behalf of others that allow users to, among other things, register for a class or conference, make campsite reservations, purchase hunting or fishing licenses, or pay a parking ticket.\r\n\r\nACTIVE also offers mobile applications that provide information about events in various geographic areas, permit users to register for races, make camping reservations, book tee times, create and download training programs, and enjoy many of the benefits of our websites, in addition to other services (collectively, \u201cApplications\u201d). In general, ACTIVE\u2019s Applications operate on an open network; meaning that any non-sensitive information that users post to these Applications may be available to other users of the same application, and, in some instances, on ACTIVE\u2019s websites.",

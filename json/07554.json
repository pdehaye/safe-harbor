Information is collected for specifically stated purposes including to extend and facilitate certain benefits to employees, which may be provided through third parties, verify employee information, process payroll, withhold or pay required taxes and to abide by certain local, state or federal laws, regulations, statutes and guidelines which may include statutory reporting requirements.  Information may also be collected relative to meeting the requirements to work according to federal laws. Any questions relating to the content of the information maintained and disclosure should be directed to the Director, WW Human Resources at Human.Resources@seminis.com  \r\nChoice:  An employee may opt to withhold certain personal information from disclosure to third parties with which Seminis shares such information for a particular stated purpose.

Seminis will endeavor to accommodate such request unless prohibited by local state, or Federal laws, regulations, statutes and guidelines. \r\nOnward Transfer: Seminis does request that any third parties hold any information we provide to them in confidence, and use the information only to provide the services we have hired them to perform for Seminis and its employees.  Seminis shall ensure the protection of employee\u2019s information by requiring that the third party subscribes by the Safe Harbor Act principles, or agrees to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles. \r\nSeminis will make every effort to preserve privacy, but may be required to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have good faith that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Seminis.\r\nOnly employment date, job title and employment status (active or non-active) will be released if requested by a third party, unless you consent that more information be released.\r\nInquiries for verification of payroll information will be provided upon written request to the Human Resources Department.

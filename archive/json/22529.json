Customers of our hosted solutions as well as of our resume screening and processing services forward candidate CV\u2019s/resumes to us or direct candidates to send their CV\u2019s/resumes to us directly for processing.  After processing, these CV\u2019s/resumes are then either returned to the customer or, at the customer\u2019s request, may be made available exclusively for that customer\u2019s review on a secure, private website and may be retained in a customer-specific database for subsequent search.  In addition, customers routinely provide Burning Glass with CV\u2019s/resumes in the course of offering performance feedback or to assist us in product improvements and algorithmic enhancement or other research and development activities.  Such data are in no case made available to other customers in any way that would cause personal information to be revealed.",

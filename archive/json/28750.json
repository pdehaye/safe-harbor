    "activities": "GET IT Mobile provides app publishers a unified platform for delivering mobile apps from any online or offline marketing channel to any mobile device, regardless of carrier, platform, app store or delivery method. An end-user who wants to download a GET IT enabled mobile app simply enters his or her mobile phone number or mobile mail address in a GET IT dialogue box and submits it to the GET IT system.  The GET IT system then responds with a smart get.it link, which is sent via text message or email to the end-user\u2019s mobile device. When the end-user clicks on the link, the browser on the end-user\u2019s mobile device automatically launches the correct app store page or other download location where the end-user can download the selected app.  GET IT Mobile app delivery can be initiated from many venues, including websites, social networks, email or even offline media.",

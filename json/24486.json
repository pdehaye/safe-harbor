We support the rights of our survey respondents by limiting the use of their information for legitimate marketing research purposes, and are active in supporting industry organizations created to uphold ethical survey research. We will never share our survey respondents' email addresses or personally identifiable information with anyone except our clients and vendors, but only for marketing research purposes and in compliance with applicable industry codes.",

    "activities": "Converus sells a product/service called EyeDetect which is used for lie detection in pre-employment and periodic employee screening. EyeDetect successfully identifies deception with 85% accuracy by a detailed analysis of the behavior of the eyes in approximately 30-40 minutes, during which the subject answers a series of true/false questions on a computer. It tracks and measures a host of ocular metrics to assess the likelihood of deception to test questions. \r\n\r\nThe answers to these questions, along with pupillary changes and eye movements are precisely measured by the eye tracker and stored on a secure, encrypted data locker. At the conclusion of the test, the data (along with some potential personal data about the subject such as an employee ID number or name, age and gender) are uploaded from the data locker to a secure cloud server where a computer safely performs the analysis and a detailed report is generated. Authorized personnel can access the report through a Web browser or mobile device to view individual responses and Credibility Index Scores. This score is the probability that the individual was truthful.",

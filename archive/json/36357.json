(\u201cDISA\u201d) gathers personal data (e.g., name, date of birth, mailing or email address, social security number, driver's license) for the purpose of supporting its clients (employers') employment practices, e.g., employee hiring, promoting and discharging.  Initially, personal consumer/employee date is received from the client and is used, in turn, to gather the information required by clients to facilitate their requirements from employment.

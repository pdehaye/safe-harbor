    "activities": "TRACE Inc. offers several due diligence services which gather personal information through consent, control, and participation from the individuals. Some of these individuals or entities are located in the EU or Switzerland. TRACE Inc. runs TRAC (\u201cTRACE Registered Access Code\u201d), which is the primary service that gathers this personal information. TRACE Inc. also offers other services such as TRACEcheck, TRACEselect, and TRACEcertification which gather varying levels of personal information from individuals and entities. Privacy is important to TRACE.  \r\n\r\nA TRAC is a single, globally-accepted identification number for businesses, individuals, charities and trusts. In order to generate a TRAC, TRACE collects personal information about TRAC Applicants (e.g., those who have submitted an application for a TRAC that is currently in process), TRAC Holders (e.g., those to whom a TRAC is issued), and their respective owners and authorized representatives, when applicable.  Obtaining and maintaining accurate and verified personal information is important to our ability to issue reliable TRACs and thereby enhance commercial transparency.\r\n\r\nThe TRACE policy describes the types of personal information we may collect, the purposes for which we may use the information, the circumstances in which we may share the information and the steps we take to safeguard this information.",

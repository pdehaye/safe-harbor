Some non-personally identifiable information may automatically be collected as users (\"you\") browse Createthe Group Inc's (\"our\") website (the \"Site\") and view Internet-based advertising (\"IBA\") we provide on behalf of our clients. Our web server automatically collects information known as \u201cclickstream data,\u201d such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Website, pages viewed, information searched for, access times and other relevant statistics. We use cookies, web beacons and log files to collect this information. Your Internet browser stores IBA-related data as cookies in some cases. If you have cookies disabled, if you delete your cookies, or if other software deletes the cookies used for that data storage, such data is permanently lost because it is not retained separately by us.\r\n\r\nPersonally Identifiable Information. In order to take advantage of certain features of the Site, we may ask you to provide your e-mail address, name, company, mailing address, phone number or other information about yourself included in messages or bulletin boards posts that you submit (including, where applicable, resumes, cover letters and other job-related correspondence). You are not required to provide us with this information, but if you choose not to, you may not be able to participate in some of the activities on this Site.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected from Other Sources. We may license and otherwise obtain non-personal information from various other companies, including research companies, data aggregation companies and other third party companies. Data sets may include information about you or your demographic segment that such companies have licensed, purchased or collected. We use this information for all the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, and for any other lawful purpose that we choose.\r\n\r\nInformation Collected By Third Parties. Some of the services and advertisements included via the Site and our IBA, as well as sites that IBA links to, are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies may place or recognize cookies, web beacons, or other technology to track certain personal and non-personal information about users. We do not have access, nor control over, third party use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used. You should check the applicable privacy polices of such third-party sites and services you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.\r\n\r\nWHAT DO WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION WE GATHER?\r\n\r\nService Participation. We may use the information we collect from you to allow you to participate in the Site activities for which the information is collected: to improve the content of the Site, to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, to notify users about updates to the Site, for our internal employee recruiting purposes, and for our internal contact database purposes. For example, when you give us your e-mail address in order to receive the free Createthe Group newsletter, that address is added to the e-mail list for the newsletter. On each e-mail you receive, you are given the opportunity to unsubscribe; once you unsubscribe, you will no longer receive such e-mails.\r\n\r\nStatistical Analysis. We may perform statistical, demographic and marketing analysis regarding users and their patterns in using the Site and viewing IBA. We use this information for analysis purposes, the results of which we may offer in aggregated form to our clients and affiliates.\r\n\r\nRelevant Advertising. We may use demographic and preference information to allow the most pertinent advertising to be targeted to users who view IBA. This means users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer\u2019s experience and the effectiveness of the ads. We disclose information to third parties only in aggregate or de-identified form.\r\n\r\nWe may use both persistent and temporary cookies to record user-specific information on what Web pages users access or visit in connection with IBA and the Site, and record past activity at the Site in order to provide better service when visitors return to the Site. We may, in the future, also use cookies to customize user experiences of the Site. We may use cookies in IBA to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, control the delivery of advertisements and generally improve your online experience with respect to the Site and the IBA we provide.\r\n\r\nWITH WHOM DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE GATHER?\r\n\r\nAny communication or material you transmit to us by email or otherwise, including any data, questions, comments, suggestions, or the like is, and will be treated as, non-confidential and nonproprietary. We may disclose such information to our clients and affiliates for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, we may disclose information we collect as follows:\r\n\r\nWithin the Company. We may use information that we collect or that you provide internally, through Createthe Group or its parent, subsidiaries or affiliates, which may change if we acquire, or are acquired by, another company.\r\n\r\nTo Third Parties. We may disclose your information to third parties (including our clients, technology partners, publishers, ad networks and administrative service providers) for purposes elsewhere described in this policy, as well as research, data validation, aggregation, enhancement, verification, suppression, marketing, advertising and other lawful purposes in providing IBA services to others. Such information does not include personally identifiable information unless you voluntarily provided it in a form that was expressly designated as part of a commercial survey or form. We do not take responsibility for any third-party entities referenced in this paragraph, which may have privacy policies different than this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nAs Required by Law. We may disclose information we collect, including personally identifiable information, to third parties as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose information:\r\n\r\n\u2022\tto regulators; \r\n\u2022\tto law enforcement authorities pursuant to official requests; and \r\n\u2022\tto vendors who provide us with services. \r\n\r\nWHEN MAY WE CONTACT YOU WITH THE INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE?\r\n\r\nBy providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails. We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us, provided that, we will not give your email address to another party to promote their products or services directly to you.\r\n\r\nIf you supply us with your postal address online you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please let us know by calling us at the number provided above.\r\n\r\nPersons who supply us with their telephone numbers online will only receive telephone contact from us regarding the request for information, contact request, or employment application they may have submitted online.",

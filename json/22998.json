    "activities": "When users purchase an Anki product from Anki.com, they provide us with their name, email, phone number, shipping and billing addresses, credit card information, and other information they affirmatively provide. When users register to receive Anki news, we collect birthdate and email address.\r\n\r\nWe may also collect users\u2019 Internet Protocol (\u2018IP\u2019) address. We use their IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.\r\n\r\nIn the Anki DRIVE App:\r\n\r\nWhen users use the Anki DRIVE App we collect their nickname (we encourage them not to use their real name), device make and model, mobile carrier, operating system version, and language their device is set to.  In addition, we collect anonymous app and gameplay data to help improve our products and services.  This information may include, but is not limited to, user IDs (such as gamer tags, profile name and nickname), game scores, game achievements, game performance, and their usage of various game features. All information collected by Anki without their explicit permission is intended to be anonymous information that does not disclose their identity or constitute personal information. \r\n\r\nWe use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Application on mobile devices.  This software may record information such as how often users use the Anki DRIVE app, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, and performance data.  \r\n\r\nWe do obtain non-personally identifiable zip-code level geographic information using devices' IP addresses. Users may turn off location services at the device level. \r\n\r\nIf users choose to use our sharing feature, the Anki DRIVE App will provide users with options to share via text messaging, email, or social applications they have on their mobile devices.\r\n\r\nUsers will have the ability to save images to their device in our results sharing feature. If they wish to do so, they will receive a notification indicating that the application would like to access their photos, which they may allow or deny.  We do not access other photos that users may have saved to their devices; we only allow them to save the image they create within our mobile application to our device. \r\n\r\nWe send push notifications to provide users with alerts and information. Users may opt-out of push notifications at the device level.",

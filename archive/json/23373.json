For the Denison Leadership Development Survey, the client organization submits a list of participants taking part in the survey which includes the participants\u2019 names and email addresses.  The participants, in turn, designate and invite raters who will assess their leadership traits from their perspective by entering the names and email addresses into Denison Consulting\u2019s web survey interface.  These names and email addresses are never made public or used for any purpose other than the leadership survey.",

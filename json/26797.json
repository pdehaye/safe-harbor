This is due to a rise in \u201cprofessional\u201d and duplicate research subjects which threatens to undermine drug development.\r\n\tWe track only partial identifiers, such as Date of Birth (DOB) and last four numbers of passport, in order to protect personal information. We do not track full identification numbers, names or addresses. The information collected is limited to: DOB, initials, last four of passport number (ex-US), last four of social security number (US), gender, height and weight. \r\n\tPrior to collecting any information, a Subject Authorization is signed by the prospective subject, outlining what data is collected and that it will be de-identified and stored indefinitely. Once collected, this personal information is encrypted and cannot be accessed by any outside parties. \r\nThe CTSdatabase Privacy Policy covers both the Subject Authorization and our website, www.ctsdatabase.com and includes:\r\n- What information is collected \r\n - How information is collected\r\n- Third Party involvement\r\n- Potential disclosure of Personal Identifiable Information\r\n- Individual access to information\r\n- Security measures to protect Personal Identifiable Information\r\n- User access and choice\r\n- Tracking technologies used and\r\n- Notification of changes in Privacy Policy",

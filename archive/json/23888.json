After providing permission to the customer to access their data for a particular device or devices, Motivation Science gathers the user's de-identified data, standardizes and normalizes the results, stores the data using 256-bit encryption, and makes the data available to the customer. The customer can retrieve users' data in bulk or filter the data based on time, user or data source. Once retrieved, the customer can re-identify the data to the user within the customer's application.",

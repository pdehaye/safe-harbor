Auth0\u00ae will use Model Contract Clauses (processor) approved by the European Commission in connection with such transfers. Please see our Terms of Service (at http://auth0.com/terms) and our Model Contract Clauses (at http://auth0.com/mcc) for more information. Auth0\u00ae will also continue to abide by the Safe Harbor Framework, and adhere to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, Auth0\u00ae commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information.  European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Auth0\u00ae at support@auth0.com.\r\n\r\nAuth0\u00ae has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Auth0\u00ae, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.",

As a move manager responsible for all aspects of the relocation process, there are situations where we may need to collect information from our transferees including, but not limited to social securtiy numbers and passport numbers/photographs.  This information must be collected for air, sea, and road shipments entering into the United States from a foreign country.  Likewise, we typically need to send these private numbers and information to our EU partners, agents, and sub-contractors who are handling shipments that we have sent to the EU on behalf of our transferee and their families moving to the EU.",

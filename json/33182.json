    "activities": "Categories of Individual Data Subjects\r\nIn general, Medidata may obtain EU Personal Data in the United States about several different types of individuals, including (i) employees, (ii) clients and (iii) client clinical study data.   Medidata's practices with respect to each of these types of individual data subjects are described below.\r\n\r\nEmployees\r\nMedidata generally collects, and uses employee information at the time of hire and with the full understanding and consent of our employees.  \r\n\r\nClients\r\nMedidata may obtain various types of EU Personal Data about employees. Such data may include contact information (names, addresses, phone and fax numbers, and email addresses).\r\n\r\nMedidata may use these types of EU Personal Data for business purposes; to establish or maintain client and business relationships; to provide access to Internet-based activities; and to conduct other activities as necessary or appropriate in connection with the service and development of the business relationship.\r\n\r\nClient Clinical Study Subjects\r\nMedidata provides a wide variety of Software as a Service (SaaS) and solutions to its business clients (\"Clients\") that facilitate services including collecting and analyzing clinical study information pertaining to individuals (\"Data Subjects\").  Although the information is anonymized, in some instances, Medidata may process EU personal data about such Data Subjects in the course of providing the services and solutions. Such data may include, but is not limited to personal healthcare information, and other administrative information depending on the particular client and how that client utilizes our SaaS solutions.  \r\nWherever we obtain access to EU personal data about Data Subjects, we are acting as a data processor on behalf of our clients, and we therefore conduct such activities strictly in accordance with their instructions and pursuant to our contractual arrangements with them.  Data Subjects with an existing relationship with one of our clients are referred to the client's website to understand the privacy practices that apply to EU personal data that we may maintain. Moreover, if a Data Subject desires access to review their EU Personal Data, they would contact our client with any such requests. We will cooperate, as appropriate, with requests from our clients to assist with such responses.\r\n\r\nMedidata protects all of the above described data through layers of protections that include encryption, logical and physical security.  FIPS 140-2 approved encryption is used during data transmission to and from the EU/US and when the data is at rest in offsite backups.  During on-site processing, a combination of logical security through strong authentication, firewalls, intrusion detection, virus, spam, and spybot filters in conjunction with physical security in the form of uniformed guards, smart ID cards and biometric door access is used to assure only authorized access to the data.  \r\n\r\nMedidata may disclose EU Personal Data to business partners and subcontractors as necessary in connection with the performance of requested services or solutions, or as otherwise appropriate in connection with a legitimate business need. Medidata may also disclose EU Personal Data as necessary in connection with the sale or transfer of all or part of the business. In these situations, Medidata will require the recipient of the data to protect the data in accordance with the relevant principles in the Safe Harbor, or otherwise take steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data are appropriately protected. Medidata may also disclose EU Personal Data where required or permitted by law, or where Medidata believes that such disclosures are appropriate in connection with a law enforcement request.\r\nData Security and Integrity\r\nMedidata has United States hosting centers that may store and process EU Personal Data in various locations. Medidata takes reasonable precautions to protect EU Personal Data in these centers from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Medidata also makes reasonable efforts to keep EU Personal Data reliable for its intended use, accurate, current and complete.",

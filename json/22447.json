Each User\u2019s individual Course Tracking Data is linked to that User\u2019s User Personal Information. \u201cUser Information\u201d means User Personal Information and other information, such as Course Tracking Data, that may be linked to Users by  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.\u2019s systems.\r\nUser Information is treated as confidential information of the Customer and is collected on behalf of, and in accordance with, each Customer\u2019s instructions.  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. uses User Information to provide feedback to the Customer and to the User about a User''s activity on a  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.-hosted Customer Web Site. For example,  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. may use User Information to send reminder e-mails and notifications to a User. \r\nAll information concerning a particular User that is in  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.'s possession, including that User's User Information, is considered the proprietary information of the Customer with which the User is associated (i.e., the User's employer).   EduNeering Holdings, Inc.'s arrangements with its Customers may require  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. to provide all such information directly to the Customer. If a User corresponds with  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. in connection with the training we offer on behalf of our Customer,  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. may keep a record of that correspondence.  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. may also forward correspondence to the Customer with which the User is associated.\r\n EduNeering Holdings, Inc. does not transfer any User Information concerning a User to any third party (other than  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.\u2019s Customer) unless it is authorized to do so by the Customer with which the User is associated in connection with the services that  EduNeering Holdings, Inc. provides to that Customer, or unless we believe such action is necessary or permissible to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of  EduNeering Holdings, Inc.; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Users or members of the public.  \r\n EduNeering Holdings, Inc. does not use User Information for marketing to third parties.",

    "activities": "As part of our online training here at BioAgilytix, we train on HIPAA Awareness, \r\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is composed of two main rules. The HIPAA privacy rule provides for the privacy of an individual's personally identifiable health information. The HIPAA Security Rule establishes standards for the privacy of electronic health information. HIPAA protects consumers from having their health information unnecessarily disclosed. The Department of Health & Human Services' Office for Civil Rights enforces HIPAA rules.\r\n\r\nIN SOP Lab-32,Chain of Custody: Receipt, Tracking and Inventory Procedure for Study Samples\r\nstates that if the paperwork contains any patient identification information, this information can be redacted (e.g. blacked out) on the documentation.  However, if this information includes unique identifiers (i.e., sample numbers) for individual samples, these identifiers must be preserved and the remaining information redacted.  In either case, the sponsor will be notified that patient identification information was present on the documentation.",

The amount and type of information that Datadog gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.\r\n\r\nFor example, when signing up for a trial of the Service, Datadog may ask a user to provide the user\u2019s name and the name of the user\u2019s company, as well as an email address and telephone number where we may contact the user and/or another representative of the user\u2019s company. Each user is also expected to provide a username and password that, along with other information, Datadog uses to create and administer accounts.\r\n\r\nAnother example is when an existing user invites a person to join Datadog. Datadog will prompt the existing user to enter the invitee's email address (but not its phone number).\r\n\r\nIn each case, Datadog collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the users' interaction with Datadog.",

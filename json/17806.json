    "activities": "As of January 21, 2013, and regardless of the nationality of our users, Sendgine collects information, which may include, but is not limited to users' (and under certain circumstances, potential users') name, address, phone number, email, title, company, credit card information, internet connection, demographics, activity and content within our web site and service, user experience details, and other information relating to support or service issues.\r\n\r\nWhenever a new person is added to a \u201ctrain of thought\u201d in Sendgine, it is done with a valid email address. We will automatically send that person an email containing the information provided (unless the user has elected Secure+ to restrict email contents), which includes an invitation to \u201cboard\u201d that train of thought and join the conversation (which requires the recipient to sign up for a Sendgine account). Sendgine stores all of this information for the purpose of sending these emails and tracking recipients\u2019 signups. Recipients may unsubscribe from these messages by clicking a link or deactivating their accounts at any time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, users can import contacts from their Google accounts (or other services which we may make available from time to time) to both populate Sendgine contacts index and/or invite them to become Sendgine users. We collect the username and password for the email account the user wishes to import contacts from and will only use it for that purpose.\r\nOur Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. Any information provided in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at support@sendgine.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.\r\nSendgine processes information through our system under the direction of our customers, and has no direct ownership of the information transferred or any relationship with individuals whose personally identifiable information may be included in such information transfers.\r\n\r\nCertain Sendgine services allow you to share information with users outside Sendgine, which are unencrypted whenever delivered by email. In order to fulfill such a request, Sendgine may require personal information about the recipient of such information, including their name, email and street addresses, (etc.); however, such personal information will be used only for the purpose for which it was originally collected, and although Sendgine will not use this personal information to market directly to such a recipient outside of the context of our user\u2019s request, Sendgine may send accompanying information about the Sendgine service along with the request (e.g. an invitation for the recipient to join Sendgine).\r\nAn individual who seeks access, who seeks to correct, amend, delete inaccurate data or withdraw consent to further contact should direct his or her query to the Sendgine ?customer they are in contact with directly. If a Sendgine customer requests removal of 3rd party data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.\r\n\r\nSendgine will retain personal data we process on behalf of our customers for as long as needed to provide services to our customers and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.\r\n\r\nSendgine does not sell or rent users\u2019 contact information to other marketers\u2014period. However, users\u2019 personal information may be shared within Sendgine and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, partners and licensors, all of whom will take the steps necessary to protect it in accordance with this privacy policy. There may also be times when it is necessary for Sendgine to share some of the personal information we have collected about users with specific companies who provide products and services on our behalf, or with whom we have a strategic relationship. For example, such companies may help us fulfill orders, process payments, organize and protect information, deliver certain services, manage or enhance certain types of customer data, provide support services, or conduct research or surveys to assess interest levels and customer satisfaction. These companies are authorized to use users\u2019 personal information to provide these services to us. These companies are obligated to protect your personal information in accordance with their personal information policies. Without sharing such personal information, it would be difficult to purchase, access and receive certain Sendgine content and services and to provide feedback about how we may improve. Please write us at support@us.sendgine.com if you would like additional information regarding these third parties.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are responsible for our own privacy practices, Sendgine is not responsible for the privacy practices of other companies\u2019 websites or services to which our services may link or otherwise refer, nor are we responsible for the data practices of any third parties with whom you may use our service via an API. If a user submits personal information to any of those sites, his or her information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage users to carefully read the privacy policy of any Web site they visit. For protection, Sendgine only stores the last four digits of any credit card or other account number a user may provide\u2014along with the billing address, expiration date and card type\u2014on our servers, and our payment processor maintains the remainder of the payment account information on behalf of our users.\r\n\r\nUnder rare circumstances, we may also disclose users\u2019 personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect users\u2019 safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request. If Sendgine is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all of its assets, users will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices users may have regarding their personal information.\r\n?\r\n?The following third party services are used to deliver certain technical functions within Sendgine. Although we may transfer personal information provided to us to these organizations for the purposes outlined below (and as further detailed in our Security Procedures), they are not owned or controlled by us. As a result, we take no responsibility for their usage terms or privacy policies, which are incorporated here and may apply to users whenever they use their services via Sendgine or otherwise. We encourage users to review the information posted at their websites, and contact them directly with any questions or concerns.\r\n\r\nAmazon AWS (United States): hosts our database and cloud storage, including users\u2019 Sendgine files and messages, within the \"US Standard Region\" (Northern Virginia or Pacific Northwest) For information, please visit http://aws.amazon.com.\r\nRecurly + Chase (Paymentech) + Authorize.NET (United States): process our financial transactions, including payments to Sendgine.

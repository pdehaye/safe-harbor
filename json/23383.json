We receive data files from our clients via email, diskettes, FTP transfer, and/or hard copy (pre-printed labels).  The data that passes through ZIP Mailing Services, Inc. is not enhanced, individually viewed or collected, or put to use for any other purpose than the fulfillment of each client\u2019s mailings according to their exact specifications.\r\n \r\nThe personal data we typically accumulate from our clients is basic mailing information, such as name, address, city, state/country, and zip code, in order to select, format, and produce mailing lists for the purpose of performing mass mailings for those clients.\r\nWhen we are in control of a client\u2019s data files, we strive to protect those files and safeguard them from access by unauthorized individuals.  Strict procedures are in place regarding access to, and the security of, the company\u2019s LAN Network.  Firewalls, passwords, and user-level security measures help to ensure that outside access is prohibited, and internal access is appropriately restricted, thereby keeping the client\u2019s data secure and private.",

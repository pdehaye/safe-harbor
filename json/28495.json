    "activities": "Aasonn has adopted the seven Safe Harbor principles of notice, choice, onward transfer (transfer to third parties), access, security, data integrity and enforcement with respect to personal information to be transferred to Aasonn Operations in the U.S. from the EEA and from Switzerland.\r\n\r\nNotice - Aasonn will notify person's in the EU about the purposes for which personal data will be collected and used. Information will be provided on how individuals can contact Aasonn with inquiries or complaints regarding personal data. Aasonn will give notice to people regarding third parties to which it discloses the information, and restrictions that limit the information's use and disclosure. \r\n\r\nChoice - Prior to releasing personal data to a third party, Aasonn will give an individual employee the opportunity to choose whether their personal data is disclosed to that third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by that individual. For sensitive data, an affirmative choice will be given to the individual if the personal data is to be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purposes authorized subsequently by the individual. \r\n\r\nTransfers to third parties\u00a0- Aasonn will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding. Where Aasonn has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Policy, Aasonn will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. \r\n\r\nAccess - Person's covered under this policy will have access to personnel information about them that Aasonn holds and will be able to correct, amend or delete information if it is inaccurate (the exception is when the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks of the individual privacy in the case in question or the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated.) \r\n\r\nRetention - Aasonn will retain personal information for a period that suits the business purpose of maintaining that information. If such personal information is for the purposes of our consulting work with a customer, that information will be destroyed immediately after any business need for that information ceases to exist. In on case will personal information be kept for more than 3 years.\r\n\r\nSecurity - Aasonn will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.\r\n\r\nData Integrity - Personal data kept by Aasonn will be relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. Aasonn will take reasonable steps to ensure that the data is reliable and that it is applied to its intended use. Aasonn will also ensure that the information is accurate, complete and correct. \r\n\r\nEnforcement - To ensure compliance with these Safe Harbor Principles, Aasonn will: 1) Commit to cooperate with the Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) of the EU countries and the Swiss FDPIC (for information received from Switzerland) in the investigation and resolution of complaints and will comply with any advice given by DPAs; 2) Employ a procedure for verifying that the commitment the company has made to adhere to the Safe Harbor Principles has been implemented; and 3) Remedy issues arising out of any failure to comply with the Principles. Aasonn acknowledges that its failure to provide an annual self-certification to the Department of Commerce will remove it from its list of participants and the transfers of information will not be allowed unless Aasonn otherwise complies with the EU Data Protection Directive and Swiss FDPIC. \r\n\r\nAasonn executive management will be the internal mechanism for ensuring compliance with the Safe Harbor Principles and facilitating the independent recourse mechanism referenced in the Enforcement provision of this Policy.",

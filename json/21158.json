    "activities": "We assist the nation\u2019s largest law firms and corporate legal departments in identifying, preparing and producing the electronic documents that are the subject of a discovery request.  This is often thousands, or more likely, hundreds of thousands of documents from many sources and in many formats. Our consultants provide the expertise required to navigate electronic discovery issues related to potential or ongoing litigation or government investigation. In our capacity as consultants, we may have occasion to be a temporary custodian of the electronic documents of a foreign corporation. However, we operate at the direction of law firms and corporate legal departments and take no independent action with regard to the disposition of any documents, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the US courts by virtue of a discovery order.",

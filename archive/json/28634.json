Our web servers are located in the USA.\r\n\r\nSome of the digital gift cards Giftbit offers work internationally, including in EU nations.\r\n\r\nNew Giftbit clients wish use our service to send digital gift cards to opt-in recipients in the EU.\r\nThis requires Giftbit to receive the email address of the gift card recipient. The client may also submit a recipient first name to personalize the gift email.\r\n\r\nGiftbit uses this information to send a CAN-SPAM compliant gift email to the recipient. Giftbit also tracks whether the recipient clicks through and claims the gift card and reports that data back to the client for the purpose of accountability.\r\n\r\nGiftbit does not use recipient data other than to fulfil and deliver an accountable gift card email to a recipient.",

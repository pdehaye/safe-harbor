    "activities": "We sell integrated web-based business application software largely to small and midsize businesses. We receive mostly business-related information from the EEA, including contact information of individual representatives of the businesses with whom we are dealing, including, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, etc. of EEA Persons (\"EEA Data\"). In connection with some services, e.g., our Lead Management services, our customers use our hosted technology platform to store and process EEA Data at their own discretion. Since EEA Data covered by this Notice is by definition sent to us by another company in the EEA (e.g., a customer of ours), the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing often depend on such other company, with whom the EEA Persons typically have a closer employment or business relationship (and which, therefore, can provide additional information on categories of data shared with us).",

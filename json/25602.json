In addition, as part of Workday\u2019s Enterprise Cloud product offerings, customers may load electronic data, including personal data, into Workday servers. In this context, Workday acts as a data processor and may use the personal data to provide and support the service, but does not control the customer\u2019s data. Workday does not select the data that is uploaded into the servers and any access to, or use of, such data is incidental to completing Workday\u2019s contractual obligations to its customer as a processor and is in accordance with customer\u2019s instructions. Similarly, as part of Workday\u2019s professional services operations, Workday processes data, including personal data, on behalf of its customers. In this context, Workday acts as a data processor and does not control the data. Furthermore, Workday also collects, transfers and uses personal information of its employees and candidates for general employment and benefit purposes (e.g., providing compensation benefits and related services, keeping updated organizational information, making employment-related decisions, administering stock and stock option programs, managing security, and employee training). As part of Workday's internal operations, Workday transfers personal data of its employees and non-employee personnel to the U.S. headquarters for processing and storage.

Herrmann collects and uses limited personal data from individuals in the EU. This data is not sensitive personal data as defined by the EU. The data collected is necessary to create a profile of the participant's thinking preferences with respect to how they are likely to interact with others. An employer will often provide this information to employees to assist them at being more effective in one-on-one and group interactions within the company and with customers/clients. There are no negative Thinking Preference Profiles identified by the HBDI\u901f survey, but rather, preferences which each person has in their thinking style.",

Also, users must provide their email address at this step. Additionally, Alpine is able to track users\u2019 location if GPS is activated in the mobile phone. Alpine will not sell or transfer this personal data to any third party. Alpine may use email addresses for targeted ads, to which users can unsubscribe, and possibly use location data to internally study location based advertising.  However, Alpine's main focus is on non-personal information pulled through the app to study users\u2019 habits, such as preferred audio settings, car and car radio type, phone type, etc.",

CrownPeak also hosts many of the websites CrownPeak customers use to communicate with their customers.\r\n\r\nFor users of the CrownPeak Content Management System (CMS) Platform, we collect identifying information when they set up their account profile to access the service.

Some of these websites collect personally identifying information.  In these cases, the nature and use of the personally-identifying information collected is determined by the CrownPeak customer.\r\n\r\nWe use the information we collect about users to authenticate them identity when they access our website.

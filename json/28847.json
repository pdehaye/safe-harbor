    "activities": "Lucidity Research provides consulting, data processing and analysis services to support clients executing survey research projects.   On occasion, these projects may entail collection of data from the EU or Switzerland.  If a client has customers in the EU or Switzerland they wish to survey by sending an email invitation, Lucidity Research may have access to those email addresses, as well as any personal information that may be submitted by survey respondents.   However, most survey data handled by Lucidity Research comes from respondents who recruited through a research panel or sampling company.  In these instances, personally identifiable information such as email, name, telephone number or address is never included in the data files we handle.",

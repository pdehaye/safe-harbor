When one of our Members requests an MSO, the first thing we do is to send to them an authorization that empowers our local, in country Third Party Administrator (TPA) to collect the relevant and necessary medical files. Unless we receive that form executed by our MISI Member, we do nothing; gather no personal information. We use only TPA\u2019s that are resident in the EU, and conducting their activity in conformity with all EU rules and regulations regarding privacy and secure secrecy. Any information sent is encrypted or sent by overnight courier directly to our office in the US.

    "activities": "The SANS Institute is a cooperative research and education organization. The personal information we collect is from student registration. We use it to remain in contact with our students and to provide them updates and news regarding their training.\r\n\r\nSANS also develops security awareness training and evaluation products.  These products are sold to organizations who use them to teach security awareness to their employees and contractors.  As part of the product service SANS will host the products purchased by the organization from SANS in the SANS Learning Management System (an online training delivery platform).  That hosting requires the client organization to deliver personal and organizational role information to SANS through this SANS Learning Management System in order to effectively deliver the training.  SANS does not use this information for any purpose other than associated with the delivery of the training.",

As part of the Social.com services (referred to herein as \u201cServices\u201d), customers are permitted to submit electronic data and information, including personal data, into servers used by Salesforce. In this context, Salesforce acts as a data processor and does not determine how its customers\u2019 data is utilized in those servers. Salesforce does not choose or determine the types of data that are submitted to servers used by Salesforce, and any access to, or use of, such data is incidental to completing the contractual obligations of Salesforce as data processor to its customers.

Specifically, Salesforce collects, transfers, and uses personal data of its current and prospective customers and current and prospective partners for sales, billing, marketing, and business partner recruitment purposes.",

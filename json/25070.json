    "activities": "We sell integrated web-based business application software largely to small and midsize businesses.  We receive mostly business-related information from the EEA, including contact information of individual representatives of the businesses with whom we are dealing, including, without limitation, names, addresses, work phone numbers, work email addresses, etc. of EEA Persons (\"EEA Data\").  In connection with some services, our customers use our hosted technology platform to store and process EEA Data at their own discretion.  Since EEA Data is sent to us by a customer in the EEA, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing often depend on such other company, with whom the EEA Persons typically have a closer employment or business relationship (and which, therefore, can provide additional information on categories of data shared with us).  We collect and use EEA Data for purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing EEA Data on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.",

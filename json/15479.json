    "activities": "IntraPace\u2019s abiliti\u2122 system is designed to be the first \u201cintelligent\u201d obesity intervention. The system contains sensors intended to track consumption events and physical activity, using this information to direct when therapy is delivered and to monitor a patient\u2019s progress toward weight loss goals. \r\nOnce implanted, and activated, the abiliti system is designed to detect when a person consumes food or drink. The system then delivers a series of low-energy electrical impulses to the stomach designed to create a feeling of fullness. Based upon individual needs, the electrical therapy, known as gastric stimulation, is customized. \r\nThe abiliti system collects the output of the food detection and activity sensors intended to provide a detailed picture of food consumption and exercise trends. These data can be downloaded in the patients\u2019 homes or at the physician\u2019s offices and may be used by patients and their healthcare providers to monitor their progress toward weight loss goals.  The data downloaded in the patients\u2019 homes may then be uploaded onto the my.abiliti website.   \r\nAll the data collected by IntraPace from its European patients is encrypted before it is sent to the IntraPace\u2019s my.abiliti website in the United States.  In the United States the data is stored on a secure server.",

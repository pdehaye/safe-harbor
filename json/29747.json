    "activities": "We link third-party cloud applications (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive) through our unified API service. In order to access these third-party systems, we require users enter their credentials for each third-party system. We receive and encrypt an OAuth token, which we store on our servers, to act on their behalf. To regularly reauthorize our service to act on their behalf, we store user credentials using state-of-the-art encryption algorithms and practices. Cloud Elements never stores other user data on our systems, rather we act as a broker between the third-party systems and our EU based users. We also store basic profile information on our EU clients (not their users) to customize their solution for their users.",

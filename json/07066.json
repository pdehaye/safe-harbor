    "activities": "Personal Information Received From the EU: LTG receives personal information from the countries in which it conducts business through its corporate web site, www.licensetech.com. The corporate site contains occasional links to promotional sites that collect data provided by visitors through online forms and surveys. We respect the confidentiality of our customers and provide options for them to opt-out of our marketing, sales, and other distribution lists.\r\nDetails on how LTG protects and uses customer data collected through our Web site are provided\r\nbelow.\r\nLTG\u2019s Corporate Web Site\r\nThe LTG web site contains registration for receiving electronic newsletters from LTG. These require visitors to give us an e-mail address, which we use to send newsletters. Subscribers can opt out of these newsletter e-mails anytime. We occasionally post other forms for promotional purposes, such as surveys and drawings, which may require additional information, such as name, address, title, company name, number of PCs and specific needs. We use this to send visitors information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. Information collected on the number of PCs per site and enterprise is used to determine if software volume license information would benefit the customer. Visitors may opt-out of receiving any mailings (see the choice/ opt-out section below).\r\nLTG\u2019s privacy policy is available on www.licensetech.com and contains complete information available to users.\r\nWhat Information is Shared\r\nGeneral web use statistics (number of hits, specific pages hit) and the statistical results obtained from survey questions asked about software or hardware use and industry trends may be shared with LTG's publisher partners. The list of customers completing an online form survey is NOT provided to LTG's publisher partners, sold to third parties or shared in any way. The name and company of a contest winner may be placed on LTG's web site, used in a press release, included in LTG's marketing materials or, in cases that involve prizes provided by an outside party, given to that party as confirmation that the prizes have been distributed.\r\nAdditional privacy pages can be found at: http://www.licensetech.com/privacy-policy.asp",

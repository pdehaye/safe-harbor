    "activities": "Cambia Information Group, LLC anticipates receiving a minimal volume of personal information, if any, from the EU. If the company receives such information, it will be in the form of client contact information, e.g., email addresses, mailing addresses, and phone numbers. The company may collect such information directly from clients and potential clients through person-to-person, individual email communications, phone communications, and postal correspondence.  The timing of collection would depend upon when the company has identified a business prospect; that is, when a potential client expresses an interest in the company's services or when the company engages a potential client in initial discussions. Despite the minimal projected volume of personal information that the company may collect from the EU, EU Safe Harbor certification is required by the company's current clients as a means of ensuring the company's compliance with EU Safe Harbor Principles.",

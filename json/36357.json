(\u201cDISA\u201d) gathers personal data (e.g., name, date of birth, mailing or email address, social security number, driver's license) for the purpose of supporting its clients (employers') employment practices, e.g., employee hiring, promoting and discharging.  Initially, personal consumer/employee date is received from the client and is used, in turn, to gather the information required by clients to facilitate their requirements from employment.  Our vendors (e.g., court researchers, runners, investigators) use the personal consumer/employee data to perform criminal searches; employment and education verifications, and other verifications to confirm the identity and determine employment eligibility.

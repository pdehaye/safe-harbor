    "activities": "GeoRiot Networks, Inc. (\u201cGeoRiot\u201d) does not sell goods or provide services to natural persons (\u201cConsumers\u201d), or engage in transactions with Consumers. GeoRiot provides certain information services (\u201cGeoRiot Services\u201d) to businesses which do sell goods or provide services to Consumers through online marketplace services such as Apple iTunes and Amazon.com (\u201cClients\u201d). In providing the GeoRiot Services, GeoRiot collects certain information, as described below, which may constitute Potential Personal Information. While GeoRiot does not believe that this Potential Personal Information is subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive, as a matter of prudence and due diligence GeoRiot has elected to attest to its adherence to the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Framework, the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, and the Privacy Principles established by the E.U. Commission. \r\n\r\nGeoRiot performs the following GeoRiot Services: \r\n\r\n\u2022 The Link Localization service redirects Consumers to a page on a nationally- or regionally-specific international online marketplace, such as the iTunes and/or Amazon online international storefronts (\u201cStorefronts\u201d), which GeoRiot applications determine is likely to be the most relevant for that Consumer based on a specialized link clicked on by that Consumer, a transaction in which the Consumer\u2019s device transmits data identifying the geographical location of the device at a level of potential specificity no more detailed than the applicable postal code (\u201cLocation Data\u201d). Localization helps ensure that the Consumer sees fewer error messages, and helps improve a Consumer\u2019s buying experience by placing them in a storefront where shipping and tax rates are minimized, and currency and language are appropriate. Localization also helps ensure the proper use of nationally- or regionally-specific affiliate programs. \r\n\r\n\u2022 The GeoRiot Data Analytics service provides Clients with marketing content based on Location Data as well as the type of computer, tablet, smartphone or other device (\u201cDevice Data\u201d) used by a Consumer, as well as the Device\u2019s operating system, browser and other applications on the Device (\u201cSoftware Data\u201d), and previous transactions using the Device (\u201cTransactions Data\u201d). Our Data Analytics service helps Clients ensure that advertising content is relevant to the Consumer and appropriate to the country or region where the Consumer is located.\r\n\r\nGeoRiot does not collect or use information such as names, addresses or other contact information, governmental or corporate identification numbers, account numbers or images, or other information which specifically identifies individuals (\u201cPersonal Data\u201d). However, the data collected by GeoRiot may include Internet protocol (\u201cIP\u201d) address numbers or \u201ccookies.\u201d Because it may be possible to use such information, or potentially other Location, Device, Software or Transaction information in combination with other information to identify individual Consumers, GeoRiot has identified this information as Potential Personal Information, and as a matter of due diligence and prudence GeoRiot has taken appropriate measures to ensure the security, integrity and ethical use of such information. GeoRiot does not combine Potential Personal Information with other data to identify individuals for purposes of the GeoRiot Services.  \r\n\r\nGeoRiot does collect some Personal Information as an ancillary function in contracting with Clients (\u201cClient Contact Information\u201d), in particular information identifying and providing contact information for the Client officer responsible for the contract. It is also possible that some Clients may be natural and not corporate persons. Client Contact Information is provided voluntarily by the Client or Client officer for use by GeoRiot for purposes of contract and account management and administration.",

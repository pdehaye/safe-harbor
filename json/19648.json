We temporarily store email attachments before moving them into cloud storage services.\r\n\r\nOn our website Attachments.me, we may collect personal information such as name and email address, which we use to administer your account, answer questions and respond to customer service requests. When you download and use our Mobile App, we or our service providers automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or \"UDID\"). But, we do not ask for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our Mobile App.\r\n\r\nWhen you use our Services platform to manage your attachments, we keep some of the Meta information about an attachment (filetype, size, filename) on a database on one of our secured servers. We also put a copy of the original document up on AWS. You can read more about their security measure here: AWS Security. It is our policy that employees do not access your data, and we have measures in place to ensure that.",

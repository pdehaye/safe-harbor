    "activities": "Our survey software is used for conducting 360 Degree Feedback assessments and other types of organizational surveys.  For the 360 Degree assessments, clients provide the names and email addresses of both participants and raters.  The survey software collects, compiles and analyzes the ratings provided by these individuals and prepares a feedback report.  This feedback is used by participants for personal and professional development.\r\nThe software is also used for employee and customer satisfaction surveys.  In these cases, clients provide us the names and email addresses of those being surveyed.  Typically the survey participants have a choice whether to complete the survey.  Individual responses are not identified.  These surveys typically include questions about demographic information such as job, department and tenure.  These questions are always optional.",

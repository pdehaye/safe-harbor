As used in this Privacy Policy, \u201cPersonal Information\u201d means any information that identifies or can reasonably be used to identify an individual WireCo EU Employee. WireCo collects and transfers Personal Information of its EU Employees among servers located in the U.S. and the EU for internal business and employment-related purposes only. Such purposes may include for example, but not limitation, general company-wide record retention, general company statistics, server space and storage needs, employment status, benefits, performance evaluations, employment duties, and other such human resources activities or other matters directly relating to the EU Employee\u2019s employment or to WireCo\u2019s internal business purposes in the normal course (collectively, the \u201cPurpose\u201d). WireCo does not use the EU Employee Personal Information for any purpose outside the scope of the Purpose described above. WireCo does not disclose EU Employee Personal Information to any third parties unless compelled to do so by governing law. WireCo only discloses an EU Employee\u2019s Personal Information within WireCo if absolutely necessary in relation to the Purpose. If WireCo must disclose an EU Employee\u2019s Personal Information for a reason outside the scope of the Purpose (other than in response to a court or agency order), WireCo will first notify the EU Employee and obtain the EU Employee\u2019s consent to such disclosure. WireCo takes reasonable efforts to accommodate EU Employees\u2019 privacy preferences, such as restricting access to Personal Information and keeping certain Personal Information anonymous.",

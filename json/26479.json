The data collected is part of Tidewater\u2019s efforts to globalize its management of its diverse workforce via a centralized human resource system.  Tidewater Inc.\u2019s human resource department will be able to review and report on global personal and job data related to available positions in various operating areas, compensation and operating expenses, and more effectively provide data to underwriters for various insurance placements that serve employees and the company.  Additionally, selected data points will be provided for compliance training initiatives, for adjudication of claims of the data subject, and for operationally required data points that will feed into a global crewing system that will manage Tidewater\u2019s global manning needs.  Such personal data may include name, national identification number (where applicable), residential address, emergency contact information, compensation, language skills, licenses, certifications, passport/visa/work permit information, pension and benefits data, and medical certifications as required by the area where the employee works.  For mariners, much of this information is already provided by the employees to the areas where they work as part of regulatory flag state and license requirements.",

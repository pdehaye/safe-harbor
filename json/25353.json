(\u201cJobDiva\u201d) provides computer services (CSV) to companies and organizations that render employment services.  JobDiva helps companies manage, track and store their job applicants' and employees' data more effectively.  On such occasions, JobDiva does not own the personal or sensitive information collected.  Rather, such information is owned by JobDiva\u2019s clients.  In fact, while such data sits on JobDiva's servers, JobDiva is not privy to and does not access such personal or sensitive information.\r\n\r\nIn addition, users of JobDiva's systems who are employees of JobDiva's clients, voluntarily provide JobDiva with limited personal information (such as name and email address) to login to JobDiva's systems.  On these occassions, JobDiva is the holder of such personal information.  No sensitive information is collected from employees of JobDiva's clients for purposes of logging in to JobDiva's systems. \r\n\r\nFinally, JobDiva does not have employees located outside of the U.S., and therefore, does not transfer its own human resources data from the EU to the US.",

While performing client work, sensitive information collected may include personal information about an individual or company trade secrets. As a practice, Fretwork does not retain personally identifying information obtained during its consulting work, and disposes of or returns such information to Fretwork\u2019s customer when project work is complete. Where Fretwork collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them, the types of third parties to which Fretwork discloses that information, and the choices and means, if any, Fretwork offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to Fretwork, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Fretwork uses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected.",

Unless Apptix has your permission, Apptix does not share with third parties any personal information you provide to Apptix. By \u201cpersonal information\u201d Apptix means information that can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, fax number, and billing, payment, usage, credit and transaction information (including credit card numbers, account numbers, and social security and taxpayer identification numbers). By \u201cthird parties\u201d Apptix means anyone who is not directly involved in the maintenance or running of the Apptix website or the Services.\r\n\r\nApptix uses personal information you provide to Apptix (on the Apptix website, or by email, fax, or correspondence, or the use of the Services) strictly for the purposes for which you have provided it. For example, if you request information about a product and provide us with contact information (which may include personal information, such as an e-mail address, mailing address, or phone number), Apptix will use that information to contact you regarding your request. In addition, Apptix may use your personal information, for example, to deliver free promotional materials or newsletters to you.

By \u201caggregate information\u201d Apptix means information that does not identify you, such as web pages viewed on the Apptix website. With this aggregate information, Apptix may monitor visitor traffic patterns, usage of the Apptix website, and undertake to improve the Apptix website\u2019s layout and design.

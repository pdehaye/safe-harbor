The information collected will depend on the party providing the information, and may include the names, addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information of Temporary Workers, as well as other information we may need, such as their employment experience, skills, and educational background.\r\n\r\nSome of Temporary Employees may enter their time worked each week for Customers into our online timekeeping system. In order to process that information, Guidant Group will need certain information from the Temporary Worker, such as hours worked, personal information, and possibly a tax ID number. This information will be used to process invoices to Customers and to calculate payments by Guidant Group to Staffing Companies. All information collected will be protected by this Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\nGuidant Group may also collect and analyze demographic and geographic information, such as the number of users in a particular city, or how many temporary employees have a certain educational background. We may from time to time report this information to marketing companies on an aggregate basis, or as required by law. We will remove any unique personal information (such as name and address) that could identify any individual in this demographic information.",

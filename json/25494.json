    "activities": "We offer a cloud based platform that select member companies (our customers) can use to manage certain quality and supply chain activities in various manufacturing industries.  We are entrusted with sensitive, operations and supply chain data.  Member companies are global in scale, as are their suppliers. Our solution allows member companies to interact with one-another.  System users are added and managed directly by their employers.  They must log in with a valid email address.  They then have the option to enter other related business contact/background information as well as manage the privacy/access restrictions to this profile information individually in their user administration section.  Outside of our application platform (app.theqab.com) we also manage a limited 'public' home page (www.theqab.com) which collects very limited information about user visits for analytical purposes and may at times allow users to submit their email/contact information for follow up purposes.  This safe harbor certification is for both websites.",

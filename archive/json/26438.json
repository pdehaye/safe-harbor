These registration forms are often linked to Lyris mailing lists, and require users to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this contact information to send users information about our company and its products and services. The information is also used to contact site visitors by e-mail for marketing purposes if they have granted permission to us to send it to them on the mailing list form (or other forms on our website), and for administrative purposes such as time and location of seminars. Users may also be contacted by phone or postal mail for marketing purposes. Any financial information collected is shared with our credit card processor to bill users for Lyris software, and is stored by our credit card processor and Lyris. We use customers\u2019 IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. The IP address is also used to gather broad, personally non-identifiable demographic information, such as the countries in which our site visitors live from.

MediaMath collects data about the media (ads) we purchase on behalf of our clients as well as visitor traffic on our clients' sites.  The comparison of these two datasets allows MediaMath to optimize the targeting of campaigns.  No personally identifiable information is collected through our buying platform, TerminalOne.  We recognize, however, that in some contexts, both IP address and unique user ID may be considered personal data under the EU's 1995 Data Protection Directive.  As a precaution, we have signed onto the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks due to the possibility that an European Data Protection Authority might deem some of the information we collect to be personal data.",

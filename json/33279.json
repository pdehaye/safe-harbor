In that capacity, SnapApp acts only as a data processor with respect to personal information that it receives from its customers. Accordingly, SnapApp has no direct relationship with the individuals whose information it receives from its customers or their business partners. SnapApp does not control such information, does not select or determine the specific types of data that it processes, and does not determine the purpose for which it is processed. Such personal information consists mostly of business-related data such as names, physical and email addresses for businesses, work titles, work phone numbers, etc. SnapApp also receives some personal information from its customers, prospective customers and business partners for its own sales and marketing activities and internal business operations. SnapApp determines the purposes and means of processing such information and, in this context, acts as a data controller.",

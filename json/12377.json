    "activities": "Epic Ads is a performance based online marketing company that works with advertisers and publishers (affiliates) to deliver search engine optimization services, display advertising, and email advertising. \r\nMost of the data collection occurs through an advertiser's website (the landing page) and Epic does not control that data. At most, Epic is an onward transfer point for such data. This data may contain PII. \r\nIn some special instances, Epic acts as both the advertiser and the publisher. On the landing pages that are hosted by Epic, we may be collecting PII. On those pages, we post our privacy policies and make sure that there is proper choice and consent.\r\nIn anticipation of our expanded reach to the EU, we plan to apply higher standards to IP addresses that are identified as belonging to an EU member country.  For this data, we plan to follow the EU guidelines and expect that our advertisers do the same. As stated earlier, since we are mostly  an onward transfer point, not a data controller, our reach is limited. Regardless, on our end, any EU data we receive will be segregated, with tougher access controls, server security, encryption, etc.",

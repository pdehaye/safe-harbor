The Tag Management System provides a secure web interface that enables our customers to create, update, delete, track, and publish website tags and related metadata that allow our customers to manage online behavioral tracking and cookies for their websites (for example, by setting their preferances to identify tags that indicate a visitor to their website has requested not to be tracked, so that the website can honor this request in accordance with the EU Cookie Directive). Ensighten's customers (\"Account Owners\") provide personally identifiable information when creating an account and when accessing the user interface to use the Tag Management System. \r\n\r\nThe personally identifiable information is collected for the purposes of authenticating account access and contacting the account owner for the purpose of establishing and maintaining an account relationship.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the foregoing PII, when Account Owners access their data via the secure web interface, Ensighten collects information about the way they use Ensighten's services, such as their IP address, the type of browser they are using, and the numbers and durations of site visits.",

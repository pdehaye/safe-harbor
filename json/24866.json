    "activities": "Visual Software supports its software installed on computers located in the EU.  To resolve issues that arise with its use and to help educational institutions tackle data integrity problems, we come in contact with learner, teacher and parent personal information.  When we access this data to resolve these issues, the data is located on the EU server and the access is done through a remote connection. The data is not downloaded to a US-based server.  Our typical method of resolving these issues is to load the issue resolution to the EU-based servers and look at the data remotely instead of downloading the data to US-based servers and using the analysis tools on the US-based servers.",

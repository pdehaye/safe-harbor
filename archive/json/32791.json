Individuals who sign up are also required to create a user name and password for their account. TrackVia uses this information to communicate with organizations during the trial period via email and phone outreach to help get organizations up and running. TrackVia may also collect personally identifiable information at other times, such as when responding to product support inquiries. This information is only used to contact the user to help resolve support inquiries. TrackVia may also contact the user via email to announce improvements to the TrackVia interface. In addition, the TrackVia application allows you to store data and information that is personally identifiable, private, or sensitive. TrackVia may use such information in the aggregate only for its own internal purposes.

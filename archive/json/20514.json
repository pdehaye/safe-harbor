    "activities": "We provide a secure online system, called \"Achieve\" to institutions and their employees around the world.  Achieve is a self service competency management, learning and development and performance management system which enables users to understand what their capability gaps are, and what needs to be done to close the gaps. Systems administrators and authorized managers can use the platform to \u201cpush out\u201d assessments, as well, as desired. Immediate access to content is available to users with or without assessments, however assessments enable users to know how well they fit within a job role, and what they need to do to enhance their job capabilities.  Unlike most performance management and learning/development systems, Achieve focuses on providing individualized learning plans and content based on the specific users requirements. Similarly, Achieve enables HR and training managers to understand what gaps exist, and what cluster of competencies might best be assembled to form a training curriculum useful for their team.  Rather than rely on guess-work, the Achieve platform adds a substantial degree of intelligence and analytical thinking into the performance management process.\r\n\r\nThe Achieve platform can be used as a self-service vehicle for end-users. Its use includes pre-employment assessments, during the onboarding process, to understand training needs, to create skill inventories across one or more teams, to design succession plans, to evaluable organizational capabilities (within a group or across multiple groups and managers) and to identify what criteria are needed for professionals to succeed within an organization.",

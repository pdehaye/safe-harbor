Talent Plus enters into agreements with its clients and provides secure web based access to its TalentBank\u00ae application to facilitate data collection and analysis based on question and answer scenarios. The users of the TalentBank application conduct a series of interviews to third party participants to determine their most pervasive characteristics and align them with current and future employment opportunities. The interviewees responses may or may not be captured holistically by the interviewer, however, a coded score is ultimately assigned to each of the roughly 70 questions. The data entry process is manual and may include questions regarding skills, job experiences, unique employee ids, home and work contact information, current employer information, and reasons for considering new employment opportunities.",

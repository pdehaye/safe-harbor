    "activities": "General Description of Xtime:\r\nXtime is a leading retention solution for automotive manufacturers and dealer service departments. Its cloud-based products help dealerships discover, deliver and retain customers and help vehicle manufacturers increase customer retention and loyalty. Xtime processes more than 2 million appointments each month and originates more than 10 percent of dealer repair orders in North America.\r\n\r\nXtime is the exclusive or preferred provider for major global automotive manufacturers in North America, including Audi, BMW, Honda, Hyundai, Infiniti, Kia, Lexus, MINI, Nissan, Toyota, Volkswagen and Volvo. Xtime is also the trusted choice for many of the industry\u2019s leading dealership groups including Asbury, AutoNation, Group 1 Automotive, Luther, MileOne and Sonic Automotive.\r\n\r\nXtime is based in Silicon Valley and has offices in Australia, Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom.\r\n \r\nPersonal information received from the EU/EEA and/or Switzerland:\r\nXtime offers automotive dealerships the opportunity to subscribe to its Xtime retention system, thereby enabling automotive dealership customers and automotive dealership personnel to submit electronic data and information, including personal data, to Xtime\u2019s servers.  In this context, Xtime acts as a data processor (rather than a data controller) and therefore does not ultimately determine precisely what customer data is processed or how it is utilized.  Any access to, or use of, personal data by Xtime is incidental to completing Xtime\u2019s contractual obligations as data processor to its automotive dealership subscribers and automotive industry partners.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in connection with Xtime\u2019s professional services operations, Xtime processes data, including personal data. In this context, as in the context of its role as a software-as-a-service hosted applications provider, Xtime acts as a data processor on behalf of automotive dealership subscribers and vehicle manufacturer business partners.\r\n\r\nAs an element of Xtime\u2019s operations, Xtime transfers personal data of current and prospective automotive dealership subscribers and other current and prospective business partners (e.g., automotive vehicle manufacturers) to U.S. data centers (owned by a third party with which Xtime contracts) for processing and storage. Xtime collects, transfers, and uses personal data of current and prospective automotive dealership customers and current and prospective business partners for sales, billing, marketing, and business partner recruitment purposes.  In this context, Xtime acts as a data controller.\r\n\r\nAs part of Xtime\u2019s internal operations, Xtime transfers personal data of its employees and non-employee personnel to Xtime\u2019s U.S. headquarters for processing and storage. Xtime collects, transfers, and uses employee data for purposes related to employee benefits and employees services. Such benefits and services include evaluation of qualifications for employment, provision of employment, compensation and benefits, reporting, security management, administration of compensation, stock option administration, performance management and company network access, authentication and personalization. In this context, Xtime acts as a data controller.\r\n\r\nOutside of the scope of Xtime\u2019s Safe Harbor registration, Xtime also stores and uses personal information collected through its publicly-accessible website in accordance with the Xtime Privacy Policy posted on its website at the following URL:  http://www.xtime.com/privacy-policy; the publicly accessible portions of the Xtime home page are only covered by Xtime\u2019s Privacy Policy and not by the Safe Harbor \u2013 as further explained in detail in Xtime\u2019s Privacy Policy and Xtime\u2019s General EEA Safe Harbor Notice.",

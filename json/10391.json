Our customers use our hosted technology platforms (i.e., the Infusionsoft SaaS application, the GroSocial SaaS application, and the CustomerHub SaaS application) to store and process data, including the personal information of EEA/CH persons, at their own discretion. \r\nSince such personal information of EEA/CH persons is by definition sent to us by another company, the categories of data sent and the purposes of processing often depend on such other company, with whom the EEA/CH persons typically have a closer employment or business relationship (and which, therefore, can provide additional information on categories of data shared with us).\r\nWe collect and use personal information of EEA/CH persons for the purposes of providing products and services to our customers, communicating with corporate business partners about business matters, processing such personal information on behalf of corporate customers, providing information on our services, and conducting related tasks for legitimate business purposes.\r\nThe scope of the Infusionsoft Safe Harbor certifications is limited to our role as a data processor and excludes data that we control.",

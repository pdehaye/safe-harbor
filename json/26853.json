BMC Software operates in the business-to-business (B2B) software industry. Unlike many companies, BMC does not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent BMC collects information online, its purpose is to better serve its business customers. As part of its employment processes, BMC collects personal and work assignment information from its employees, including  contact information, National ID, Date of Birth and other personal data necessary for the administration of employment and benefits. BMC also collects Emergency Contact information as provided by its employees. BMC uses third party administrators to administer our health care and retirement planning benefits. Those administrators also collect personal information as provided by our employees. \r\nRegarding BMC\u2019s software-as\u2013a\u2013service product offerings, BMC acts as a data processor with respect to EU/EEA and/or Swiss personal data it receives, stores or processes on behalf of, and at the direction of, BMC customers who purchase these products.  \r\nWhen providing support or services related to its software products, BMC Software may receive personal data controlled by a customer about their customers and employees.",

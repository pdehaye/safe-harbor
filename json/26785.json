Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve the HyperOffice Service, (ii) to administer the users use of the Service, (iii) to better understand a user\u2019s needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve the user\u2019s experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. HyperOffice provides a cloud-based collaboration, email and mobility service to small and medium sized businesses across all industries. Clients of HyperOffice register for a private portal where they determine the login url, login names and passwords. The portal administrator from each client organization will then add new users to their portal and will control access, security and permission levels in their portal. Users of each private portal will then have full control over what information they add to their portal, whether the information is shared, and who it is shared with. The portal admin and each user have the freedom to change their login name and password. They can remove information from the portal and decide how to share this information. Clients can cancel their service with HyperOffice at any time and request that we delete all their information from their portal. All data received from from the EU/EEA and/or Switzerland, such as organization's data will be uploaded on to HyperOffice\u2019s secure, dedicated servers for the purpose of making this data available to each user with appropriate rights and access.",

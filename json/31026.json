We also offer an option to provide long-term storage of the data on a Cloud based platform (which is Amazon that meets all of the security requirements for archived data).  We are a Network Services provider and our employees are not involved in any of the Clinical Trial activities around the data transferred or stored.  The data is de-identified at the customers workstation prior to upload and remains de-identified and encrypted during the entire transmission and storage.  AG Mednet employees do have credentials to view this data under rare service and support situations if needed but this is not standard practice for our company.",

For example, we may collect Personal Information from Customers (such as an e-mail address, system information and problem descriptions) in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting. If any Customer choose to correspond with us through electronic communication (e.g. email, online chat or instant messaging), we may retain a copy of the electronic communication together with the customer email address and our responses. We provide the same protections for these electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of information received by mail and telephone.\r\n\r\nWhen Accessing Hosted Solutions\r\nOBA also provides hosted medical communication software services to its customers around the globe, customers using hosted services are responsible for managing the data that they store at OBA\u2019s data center.

These software tools may also collect information regarding the client access of our hosted solutions and computer network.\r\nDisclosure of Personal Information \r\nOBA is not in the business of selling or sharing information with any entity not directly involved in providing the Services. OBA will never review, share, distribute, print, reference, or disclose any personal information, including any personal information received from the EU, EEA and/or Switzerland to any third-party for any purpose that has not been disclosed in this Privacy Policy unless: the Company has provided sufficient notice and Visitors and Customers have had an opportunity to exercise choice, as outlined below, with respect to such use or disclosure; disclosure of such personal information has been agreed to by Visitors or Customers and OBA in conjunction with a contractual agreement, or in such cases where applicable law permits the use or disclosure without requiring that OBA first comply with the Safe Harbor\u2019s Notice and Choice Principles. Unless described in this Privacy Policy, OBA does not share, sell, rent, or trade any information provided with third parties for their promotional purposes.\r\nOB A reserves the right to use or disclose information if required by law or if OBA reasonably believes that its use or disclosure is necessary to protect the Company\u2019s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process and is permissible under the Safe Harbor Principles.",

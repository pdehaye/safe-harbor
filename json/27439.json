But we don\u2019t use that information to identify users, and we handle and disclose these addresses in the same way we handle other potentially personally identifying information as described in our Privacy Policy.\r\n\r\n(2) Information users provide to us directly. \u00a0Certain visitors to the network choose to interact with it in ways that may require them to provide us with personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that is provided depends on the nature of the interaction. \u00a0In each case, we only collect as much information as is necessary or appropriate given the type of interaction. We do not disclose personally identifying information other than as described in our Privacy Policy. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain network-related activities.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the ways we may use personal information:\r\nTo allow users to register for our web sites, online communities and other services, and to administer and process these registrations\r\nTo communicate with users about our products, services and related issues\r\nTo evaluate the quality of our products and services, and to enhance and customize users' experience on our web sites\r\nTo maintain and administer our web sites and comply with our legal or internal obligations and policies\u00a0\r\nTo transfer information to others as described in our Privacy Policy or to satisfy our legal, regulatory, compliance, or auditing requirements",

    "activities": "Digonex, through the Nabit software, optionally collects both personally and non-personally indentifiable information. The user may give us his or her name, email address, and address to receive product information and updates. We also optionally collect postal code, income bracket, age bracket, and gender. The Nabit software is used for eBay auction monitoring. Through the software, we may collect (again, at the user's option) the names of the items the user is monitoring, whether that user is winning, losing, or watching the auction, and the ending time of that auction. We use this information, tied with the non-personally identifiable postal code, gender, age and income bracket to identify how our customers make use of Nabit, and in which products they may be interested in the future.",

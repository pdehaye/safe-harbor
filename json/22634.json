    "activities": "Coinbase is a hosted bitcoin wallet and exchange service.  We collect personal information from and about our customers as necessary to support operations, process payments to or from customers, and to comply with certain recordkeeping requirements applicable to U.S. Money Service Businesses.  The type of personal information we collect depends on an individual\u2019s particular use of Coinbase Services.  At a minimum, Coinbase users must provide an e-mail address and user ID. In connection with our anti-fraud policy, Coinbase also continuously collects information about users\u2019 access to our website.  This data includes IP address and certain device information.  If a user elects to use the Coinbase Exchange Service to purchase or sell bitcoins, Coinbase and/or its payment vendor collects payment information, such as credit card or bank account information in order to process payments. Full credit card data is stored with a qualified payment vendor in accordance with payment card industry data security standards (PCI DSS). Coinbase may also ask users to verify their mobile phone number in order to enable enhanced security measures around the customer\u2019s Coinbase Account.  Users wishing to expand their use of the Coinbase Exchange Service beyond certain thresholds must submit additional information in connection with Coinbase\u2019s anti-money laundering and other compliance policies.  This information may include customer taxpayer identification or other government identification number, date of birth, and address.  Coinbase may also use third-party data vendors to procure additional information as set forth in our privacy policy, or to verify information submitted by a customer. In connection with its operations, Coinbase also maintains transaction histories of customers\u2019 account activity, including bitcoin purchases or sales and records of bitcoin transfers.  The most sensitive personal information, such as passwords, taxpayer identification numbers, bank account numbers, and credit card numbers is fully encrypted and access is extremely limited.",

In the process of filling out this questionnaire, users are asked to provide information about their medical condition (such as disease stage or medications taken), age and ZIP code. At the request of the user, we use this information to match against the clinical trial criteria. Users who wish to register for a particular clinical trial and to be referred to a study site are asked to supply us with the patient\u2019s name, telephone number and e-mail address. This information is forwarded to the clinical site so that they may contact the patient directly about participation in the study. On some of our Sites users may be able to order products, submit queries, or download information.",

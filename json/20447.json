    "activities": "We offer sales professionals employed by our clients assessments called the Sales Talent Predictor\u2122 (\u201cSTP\u201d) and the Sales Talent Indicator\u2122 (\u201cSTI\u201d), both of which are administered in a secure, on-line environment.  Respondents are asked a series of questions about their sales environment, their sales-related attributes, and, in the case of the STP, their approach to executing various sales competencies.  Data collected from these assessments is compiled into individual and organizational reports characterizing current and preferred potential approaches to various sales competencies.   In addition, we offer time management assessments known as the Sales Focus Analyzer\u2122 and the Revenue Management Analyzer\u2122.  The time assessment templates are distributed by Revenue Storm Client Project Managers (\u201cCPMs\u201d) via e-mail, then completed and returned by our client\u2019s sales professionals, also via e-mail.  The CPMs manually process the responses into individual results reports.\r\n\r\nThe reports and original data for all these assessments reside on a restricted access FTP site accessible only to two-to-three designated Revenue Storm administrators as well as a limited number of client-appointed  administrators who only have access to the information specific to their company.  The reports are used to assess organizational sales readiness, define personal and organizational development plans, and evaluate the \u201cfit\u201d between assessed job candidates and various kinds of sales positions.  In the case of readiness and development plans, the reports are provided to both the salesperson and the salesperson\u2019s manager, along with coaching to ensure the results are interpreted and used according to our policies and guidelines.  We occasionally qualify client-employed internal lead coaches (\u201cILCs\u201d) to provide this coaching to managers and salespeople within their company.  In the case of job candidate assessment, the reports are provided to the hiring sales manager along with interpretation assistance from a Revenue Storm coach.\r\n\r\nClient administrators are encouraged to collect their company\u2019s information from the FTP site and incorporate it into their secure human resources management system.  Reports and data are left one FTP site for six months, at which time they are moved to \u201ccold storage\u201d, where only a Revenue Storm administrator has access to them.\r\n\r\nthe Sales Focus Analyzer\u2122, and the Revenue Management Analyzer\u2122.

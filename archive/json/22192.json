    "activities": "Introduction\r\n\r\nTopSchool, Inc., provides online services to colleges and universities through our TopSchoolLive service.  TopSchoolLive is focused on back office tasks that support the student lifecycle.  The student lifecycle begins when an individual shows interest in the college or university (a prospect) and continues through enrollment, academic activities, financial aid management, financial tracking, and ends with helping the student find a job (career services).  TopSchoolLive provides services for all of these areas.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of our customers are US-based with US students.  Our customers in the EU have EU-based students.  We treat all students for all customers the same.  In other words, the information below applies to both EU and non-EU students. \r\n\t\r\nTypes of PII Collected and How It Is Used\r\n\r\nIn the process of providing services across the student lifecycle, PII of several forms is utilized by TopSchoolLive. \r\n\r\nStudent name, address, birth date, and social security number are collected. This is used to uniquely identify the student. \r\n\r\nAdditional information such as previous schooling, prior transcripts, and employment history may also be collected.  This is used to qualify the student before enrollment and is used to guide  their academic program.   \r\n\r\nFinancial aid information and student charges (tuition, fees, school charges and student payments against these fees) are also collected and processed.  This is used to ensure the student is making the necessary payments to cover their academic costs.  \r\n\r\nTopSchoolLive also supports payments against student charges.  Either a student or a school employee can input credit card information to make a payment.  This information is not stored in the TopSchoolLive system at any time.  It is passed to our credit card merchants, either Paypal or Merchant Solutions.  At no time is this information found in our databases.\r\n\r\nOther Input of PII Data\r\n\r\nSome PII data described above is input into TopSchoolLive as documents (transcripts, resumes, etc.) uploaded by school personnel or students.  Some is input manually by school personnel through the TopSchoolLive user interface.  Some data is input through our APIs (application programming interfaces) from the customer or by third parties on behalf of the customer.  \r\n\r\nSome PII is also input through our import tools.  These tools are used to enter in large amounts of data.  Commonly, this is needed when a school becomes a customer and all their existing data needs to be entered into TopSchoolLive.\r\n\r\nThird Party Involvement\r\n\r\nTopSchoolLive has electronic interfaces with 3 Learning Management Systems (eCollege, Moodle, and Agilix).  These Learning Management Systems provide services to instructors (at the request of our customers) to help them in the classroom.  Student data such as grades, course information, and social security numbers may be exchanged between these 3 service providers and TopSchoolLive.\r\n\r\nTopSchoolLive also has electronic interfaces with 2 Financial Aid Systems (Global and Ed Express).  These Financial Aid Systems provide financial aid information to TopSchoolLive at the request of our customers.  Student data such as disbursement amounts and timing as well as student names and social security numbers may be exchanged between them and TopSchoolLive.\r\n\r\nRetention\r\n\r\nData stored in the TopSchoolLive system is retained until the customer ends its relationship with TopSchool, Inc.  Historical information is a key part of a college or university\u2019s business (for example, providing accurate student transcripts).\r\n\r\nwww.TopSchoolinc.com\r\n\r\nThe TopSchool, Inc. corporate website utilizes PII in a limited way.  If an online inquiry or demo is requested, first name, last name, address and email are collected.  If a user submits a comment to our blog, their name and email is collected.  This information is retained in an offline customer management system. It may be used to contact the user in the future.",

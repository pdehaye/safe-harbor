Personally identifiable information includes your e-mail address, name, postal/mailing address, telephone numbers, social security number, credit card details, shipping and billing addresses, or a persistent identifier (such as a customer number held in a cookie) which is associated with personally identifiable information, as well as other information that you may provide voluntarily. We collect such personally identifiable information that you give us so that we may:\r\n \r\n\u2022 provide you with information about the Services;\r\n\u2022 tell you about products and services and provide information to our third party marketing partners, subject to this policy;\r\n\u2022 notify you about new features available through the Services;\r\n\u2022 respond to your requests for information;\r\n\u2022 process survey results and other data you provide;\r\n\u2022 process contest entries;\r\n\u2022 process online purchases and payments;\r\n\u2022 provide you products or Services you order;\r\n\u2022 filter the products and information we offer; and\r\n\u2022 open, maintain and administer user accounts.\r\n \r\nWe will use the personally identifiable information we collect to provide you with specific information and services that you request, and with additional information and services that may be of interest to you. By providing your personally identifiable information, you fully understand and consent to the collection and processing of such information in the United States of America and other countries. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. While we strive to protect our user's personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk. We will provide you reasonable access to personal information that you provided through the Website and the reasonable ability to review and correct it, as applicable. We may also collect non-personal information such as your IP address and use 'cookies' on the website. The information obtained from collecting IP addresses and using 'cookies' is not personal information about you. For more information, please read the sections on IP addresses and cookies below.\r\n \r\nLocation-Based Information\r\nWe may collect information relating to your general location based on (1) information you manually provide, (2) the IP address of your computer, (3) Global Positioning System (GPS) information sent to us by your GPS-enabled device, and (4) the proximity of your laptop computer, mobile wireless device, personal digital assistant, personal communication system, or other communications device (your \u201cPersonal Communication Device\u201d) to the nearest radio tower or cell site. We may also be able to detect when your Personal Communication Device is activated as well as when and how you are using it. We may collect data to verify the information you provide manually and to provide you with location-based content. We may associate Personally Identifiable Information with location-based information provided by you or your Personal Communication Device solely for our internal use and to improve your experience with the Services.\r\n \r\nDisclosure of Information\r\nS101 will not release any personal information to third parties without your consent except as follows:\r\n \r\n(1) Anyone providing us their personally identifiable information grants us and our affiliates the right to use their information for the provision of Services to you and for the benefit of S101 without restrictions for the purposes that include, without limitation, research, marketing, and content and lead development.  S101 does not collect or disclose personally identifiable information that is unrelated to these purposes.  And if we wish to disclose personally identifiable information we have collected for purposes other than those stated in this Privacy Policy, we will ask for your consent to do so.  For some users of our website-building service, we may publish your email address as a point of contact for users and visitors of the built site.\r\n(2) S101 may share information we collect with our business and third party marketing partners. If we share your information, we will request that such third parties treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and refrain from disclosing or using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than for the provision of Services to you or for the benefit of S101. Our third party marketing partners may also send you special promotions and offers for related services, at their sole discretion. To the extent required, you hereby authorize this use of your personally identifiable information.\r\n(3) We may disclose information collected on this site, including personal information, to third parties as required or permitted by law. For example, we may disclose information:\r\n\r\n\u2022 to regulators;\r\n\u2022 to law enforcement authorities pursuant to an official request;\r\n\u2022 to vendors who provide us with service; or\r\n\u2022 to companies that may acquire part or all of S101 or an affiliated company.\r\n \r\nS101 is not responsible for the protection of the information you provide to other websites. You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information on other websites, such information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited communications.",

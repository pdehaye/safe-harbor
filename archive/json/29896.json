Specifically, CliniCallRN takes calls from people responding to advertisements regarding participation in clinical research studies. CliniCallRN's European-based call center agents use IRB/IEC approved scripts for informing and pre-screening callers. If the caller provides their verbal authorization, their data is sent directly to a European-based clinical research clinic for further evaluation. These IRB/IEC approved scripts also provide the caller with an option to have their information deleted from the database. The data passes through, or is stored as authorized in a secure US based server. Data from European callers is never used or disclosed to any third party in the US for any reason.",

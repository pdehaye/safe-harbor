    "activities": "ARX offers an online service called CoSign Cloud for the purpose of providing subscribers a digital signature application. People can browse the site without telling ARX who they are or revealing any Personal Information.  If one enrolls in our service they must complete an enrollment process by completing an application form and creating a user name and password.  During use of the service ARX may also collect other Personal Information, including: name, e-mail, physical address, telephone number, billing information and other data described in our privacy policy. Once we obtain Personal Information, the subscriber is no longer anonymous to us.  ARX collects Personal Information to provide subscribers with a secure online application for creating digital signatures.  We limit the Personal Information we collect to the data we consider necessary for achieving this purpose, and for managing our site.  We use this information to set up the subscriber\u2019s account, improve the service\u2019s operation, provide technical support, and to contact the subscriber about the service for related business purposes.  We are the sole owners of the compilation of Personal Information collected on this site. During the enrollment process we collect contact information for billing purposes and to process application for enrollment. If we have trouble processing an application, we will use this information to contact the applicant and confirm with them their desired service level.  In addition, the subscriber may be asked to give credit card information to a third party that is PCI DSS compliant for handling this data; see http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/.  We do not retain nor do we view any of credit card information ourselves.",

    "activities": "ASSIA develops software for managing DSL networks.  ASSIA does not itself collect personal information of EU residents.  However, ASSIA may receive personal information regarding a DSL operator's customers for purposes of trialing ASSIA's products, integrating ASSIA's products with the DSL operator's network, or resolving technical issues relating to ASSIA's products.  In all of these instances, ASSIA receives a limited amount of personal information and for a limited period of time, only.  In all other cases, the personal data of the DSL operator's customers resides at the DSL operator and not at ASSIA.  ASSIA therefore subscribes to Safe Harbor provisions for data protection and resolution of disputes, but relies upon its DSL operator customers to implement the Notice and Choice principles of Safe Harbor.  \r\nPersonal information received by ASSIA typically includes a DSL subscriber's address and phone number (but not the customer's name).",

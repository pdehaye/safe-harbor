    "activities": "Personal information received from the EU contains data required to process and administer pay and benefits for employees working in the EU.  The type of personal information typically includes name, address, birth date, government identification numbers and dependents.   Most information is collected in order to capture enrollment in benefits, calculate the cost of benefits and report to providers.  Some information may not be needed for eligibility or pricing, such as government identification numbers, but it is required by the payroll providers, and sometimes the benefit providers, in order to complete their reporting obligations to their governments.   Any personal information that is not deemed necessary for benefits or pay purposes, is not stored within the system.",

    "activities": "Imaging Core Lab-Clinical Research\r\nWe are sub-contractors to sponsors (at this point in the medical device industry - in the future- also to CRO's and pharmaceutical companies.)  We upload images and patient data from sites around the world including the EU, Canada, and the US.  The data is redacted prior to transfer to our central servers here in Knoxville, TN.  Should any data remain on the \"screenshot\" images it is manually redacted upon arrival.  Data is encrypted, password secured, and backed up daily.  Anonymity and patient as well as data protection and fidelity are key to any clinical trial. We analyze the imaging data here centrally and collect all imaging results centrally for the length of the clinical trial.  Data is then securely retained either by us or by the sponsor as required.  Direct patient relationships are typically handled by the sponsor and/or the sponsor's designees at the clinical investigative sites. We adhere to Safe Harbor principles in all these endeavors.",

    "activities": "Opinly is a market research panel which is managed by AUS (\"AUS Marketing Research Systems, Inc.\"). We are committed to maintaining the privacy of all personal information we gather.  Our online research panel asks panelists to complete online surveys each week.  The surveys enable our clients to understand the opinions of our panelists.    We collect personal information during the recruitment process so that we can contact our panelists for applicable surveys.  We also use their personal information to send rewards to our panelists for completing surveys.  Panelists can update personnel information on their member page when they choose to do so.  The information we gather to send surveys and rewards include first name, last name, email address, if available home and cell telephone number, and home address.  We engage a third party vendor to fulfill rewards for our panelists.  The panelist also provides home address and email information to our vender that fulfills the rewards they select.  \r\nPanelist data is retained as long as panelists are active members of Opinly.  Panelist can unsubscribe their membership at any time.  If a panelist unsubscribes their personal information (name, address, email) is removed from the database within 48 hours..",

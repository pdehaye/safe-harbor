Using a webcam, interviews are performed in two ways: (1) Asynchronously, where a candidate responds to a set of pre-recorded questions and (2) Synchronously or live, where a candidate and up to 3 other participants interact in real-time. In an asynchronous interview, video responses are stored by InterviewStream, while in a live interview, the session's video streams can be recorded and stored at the discretion of the interview host. In addition to video responses, InterviewStream stores the following information of interview participants: name, email and any comments or documents that are uploaded (.doc, .pdf, .xml).",
